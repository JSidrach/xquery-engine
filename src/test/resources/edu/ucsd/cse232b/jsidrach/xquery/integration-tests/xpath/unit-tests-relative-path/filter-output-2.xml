  <LINE>This was the noblest Roman of them all:</LINE>
  <LINE>All the conspirators save only he</LINE>
  <LINE>Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;</LINE>
  <LINE>He only, in a general honest thought</LINE>
  <LINE c1="1">And common good to all, made one of them.</LINE>
  <LINE>His life was gentle, and the elements</LINE>
  <LINE c2="0">So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up</LINE>
  <LINE>And say to all the world 'This was a man!'</LINE>

  <LINE>According to his virtue let us use him,</LINE>
  <LINE>With all respect and rites of burial.</LINE>
  <LINE c2="1">Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,</LINE>
  <LINE>Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.</LINE>
  <LINE>So call the field to rest; and let's away,</LINE>
  <LINE c1="1">To part the glories of this happy day.</LINE>
