        <SPEAKER>FLAVIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:</LINE>
        <LINE>Is this a holiday? what! know you not,</LINE>
        <LINE>Being mechanical, you ought not walk</LINE>
        <LINE>Upon a labouring day without the sign</LINE>
        <LINE>Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>First Commoner</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Why, sir, a carpenter.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?</LINE>
        <LINE>What dost thou with thy best apparel on?</LINE>
        <LINE>You, sir, what trade are you?</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,</LINE>
        <LINE>as you would say, a cobbler.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>But what trade art thou? answer me directly.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe</LINE>
        <LINE>conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,</LINE>
        <LINE>if you be out, sir, I can mend you.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Why, sir, cobble you.</LINE>

        <LINE>Thou art a cobbler, art thou?</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I</LINE>
        <LINE>meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's</LINE>
        <LINE>matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon</LINE>
        <LINE>to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I</LINE>
        <LINE>recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon</LINE>
        <LINE>neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>FLAVIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>But wherefore art not in thy shop today?</LINE>
        <LINE>Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself</LINE>
        <LINE>into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,</LINE>
        <LINE>to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?</LINE>
        <LINE>What tributaries follow him to Rome,</LINE>
        <LINE>To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?</LINE>
        <LINE>You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!</LINE>
        <LINE>O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,</LINE>
        <LINE>Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft</LINE>
        <LINE>Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,</LINE>
        <LINE>To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,</LINE>
        <LINE>Your infants in your arms, and there have sat</LINE>
        <LINE>The livelong day, with patient expectation,</LINE>
        <LINE>To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:</LINE>
        <LINE>And when you saw his chariot but appear,</LINE>
        <LINE>Have you not made an universal shout,</LINE>
        <LINE>That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,</LINE>
        <LINE>To hear the replication of your sounds</LINE>
        <LINE>Made in her concave shores?</LINE>
        <LINE>And do you now put on your best attire?</LINE>
        <LINE>And do you now cull out a holiday?</LINE>
        <LINE>And do you now strew flowers in his way</LINE>
        <LINE>That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!</LINE>
        <LINE>Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,</LINE>
        <LINE>Pray to the gods to intermit the plague</LINE>
        <LINE>That needs must light on this ingratitude.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>FLAVIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,</LINE>
        <LINE>Assemble all the poor men of your sort;</LINE>
        <LINE>Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears</LINE>
        <LINE>Into the channel, till the lowest stream</LINE>
        <LINE>Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.</LINE>
        <STAGEDIR>Exeunt all the Commoners</STAGEDIR>
        <LINE>See whether their basest metal be not moved;</LINE>
        <LINE>They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.</LINE>
        <LINE>Go you down that way towards the Capitol;</LINE>
        <LINE>This way will I disrobe the images,</LINE>
        <LINE>If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>May we do so?</LINE>
        <LINE>You know it is the feast of Lupercal.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>FLAVIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>It is no matter; let no images</LINE>
        <LINE>Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,</LINE>
        <LINE>And drive away the vulgar from the streets:</LINE>
        <LINE>So do you too, where you perceive them thick.</LINE>
        <LINE>These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing</LINE>
        <LINE>Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,</LINE>
        <LINE>Who else would soar above the view of men</LINE>
        <LINE>And keep us all in servile fearfulness.</LINE>

      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>I am not gamesome: I do lack some part</LINE>

        <LINE>Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;</LINE>
        <LINE>I'll leave you.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Brutus, I do observe you now of late:</LINE>
        <LINE>I have not from your eyes that gentleness</LINE>
        <LINE>And show of love as I was wont to have:</LINE>
        <LINE>You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand</LINE>
        <LINE>Over your friend that loves you.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Cassius,</LINE>
        <LINE>Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,</LINE>
        <LINE>I turn the trouble of my countenance</LINE>
        <LINE>Merely upon myself. Vexed I am</LINE>
        <LINE>Of late with passions of some difference,</LINE>
        <LINE>Conceptions only proper to myself,</LINE>
        <LINE>Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;</LINE>
        <LINE>But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--</LINE>
        <LINE>Among which number, Cassius, be you one--</LINE>
        <LINE>Nor construe any further my neglect,</LINE>
        <LINE>Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,</LINE>
        <LINE>Forgets the shows of love to other men.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;</LINE>
        <LINE>By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried</LINE>
        <LINE>Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.</LINE>
        <LINE>Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,</LINE>
        <LINE>But by reflection, by some other things.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>'Tis just:</LINE>
        <LINE>And it is very much lamented, Brutus,</LINE>
        <LINE>That you have no such mirrors as will turn</LINE>
        <LINE>Your hidden worthiness into your eye,</LINE>
        <LINE>That you might see your shadow. I have heard,</LINE>
        <LINE>Where many of the best respect in Rome,</LINE>
        <LINE>Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus</LINE>
        <LINE>And groaning underneath this age's yoke,</LINE>
        <LINE>Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,</LINE>
        <LINE>That you would have me seek into myself</LINE>
        <LINE>For that which is not in me?</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:</LINE>
        <LINE>And since you know you cannot see yourself</LINE>
        <LINE>So well as by reflection, I, your glass,</LINE>
        <LINE>Will modestly discover to yourself</LINE>
        <LINE>That of yourself which you yet know not of.</LINE>
        <LINE>And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:</LINE>
        <LINE>Were I a common laugher, or did use</LINE>
        <LINE>To stale with ordinary oaths my love</LINE>
        <LINE>To every new protester; if you know</LINE>
        <LINE>That I do fawn on men and hug them hard</LINE>
        <LINE>And after scandal them, or if you know</LINE>
        <LINE>That I profess myself in banqueting</LINE>
        <LINE>To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <STAGEDIR>Flourish, and shout</STAGEDIR>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>What means this shouting? I do fear, the people</LINE>
        <LINE>Choose Caesar for their king.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Ay, do you fear it?</LINE>
        <LINE>Then must I think you would not have it so.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.</LINE>
        <LINE>But wherefore do you hold me here so long?</LINE>
        <LINE>What is it that you would impart to me?</LINE>
        <LINE>If it be aught toward the general good,</LINE>
        <LINE>Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,</LINE>
        <LINE>And I will look on both indifferently,</LINE>
        <LINE>For let the gods so speed me as I love</LINE>
        <LINE>The name of honour more than I fear death.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</LINE>
        <LINE>As well as I do know your outward favour.</LINE>
        <LINE>Well, honour is the subject of my story.</LINE>
        <LINE>I cannot tell what you and other men</LINE>
        <LINE>Think of this life; but, for my single self,</LINE>
        <LINE>I had as lief not be as live to be</LINE>
        <LINE>In awe of such a thing as I myself.</LINE>
        <LINE>I was born free as Caesar; so were you:</LINE>
        <LINE>We both have fed as well, and we can both</LINE>
        <LINE>Endure the winter's cold as well as he:</LINE>
        <LINE>For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</LINE>
        <LINE>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</LINE>
        <LINE>Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now</LINE>
        <LINE>Leap in with me into this angry flood,</LINE>
        <LINE>And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,</LINE>
        <LINE>Accoutred as I was, I plunged in</LINE>
        <LINE>And bade him follow; so indeed he did.</LINE>
        <LINE>The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it</LINE>
        <LINE>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</LINE>
        <LINE>And stemming it with hearts of controversy;</LINE>
        <LINE>But ere we could arrive the point proposed,</LINE>
        <LINE>Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'</LINE>
        <LINE>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</LINE>
        <LINE>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</LINE>
        <LINE>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</LINE>
        <LINE>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</LINE>
        <LINE>Is now become a god, and Cassius is</LINE>
        <LINE>A wretched creature and must bend his body,</LINE>
        <LINE>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</LINE>
        <LINE>He had a fever when he was in Spain,</LINE>
        <LINE>And when the fit was on him, I did mark</LINE>
        <LINE>How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;</LINE>
        <LINE>His coward lips did from their colour fly,</LINE>
        <LINE>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</LINE>
        <LINE>Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:</LINE>
        <LINE>Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans</LINE>
        <LINE>Mark him and write his speeches in their books,</LINE>
        <LINE>Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'</LINE>
        <LINE>As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me</LINE>
        <LINE>A man of such a feeble temper should</LINE>
        <LINE>So get the start of the majestic world</LINE>
        <LINE>And bear the palm alone.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <STAGEDIR>Shout. Flourish</STAGEDIR>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Another general shout!</LINE>
        <LINE>I do believe that these applauses are</LINE>
        <LINE>For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</LINE>
        <LINE>Like a Colossus, and we petty men</LINE>
        <LINE>Walk under his huge legs and peep about</LINE>
        <LINE>To find ourselves dishonourable graves.</LINE>
        <LINE>Men at some time are masters of their fates:</LINE>
        <LINE>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</LINE>
        <LINE>But in ourselves, that we are underlings.</LINE>
        <LINE>Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?</LINE>
        <LINE>Why should that name be sounded more than yours?</LINE>
        <LINE>Write them together, yours is as fair a name;</LINE>
        <LINE>Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;</LINE>
        <LINE>Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,</LINE>
        <LINE>Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.</LINE>
        <LINE>Now, in the names of all the gods at once,</LINE>
        <LINE>Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,</LINE>
        <LINE>That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!</LINE>
        <LINE>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!</LINE>
        <LINE>When went there by an age, since the great flood,</LINE>
        <LINE>But it was famed with more than with one man?</LINE>
        <LINE>When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,</LINE>
        <LINE>That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?</LINE>
        <LINE>Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,</LINE>
        <LINE>When there is in it but one only man.</LINE>
        <LINE>O, you and I have heard our fathers say,</LINE>
        <LINE>There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd</LINE>
        <LINE>The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome</LINE>
        <LINE>As easily as a king.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;</LINE>
        <LINE>What you would work me to, I have some aim:</LINE>
        <LINE>How I have thought of this and of these times,</LINE>
        <LINE>I shall recount hereafter; for this present,</LINE>
        <LINE>I would not, so with love I might entreat you,</LINE>
        <LINE>Be any further moved. What you have said</LINE>
        <LINE>I will consider; what you have to say</LINE>
        <LINE>I will with patience hear, and find a time</LINE>
        <LINE>Both meet to hear and answer such high things.</LINE>
        <LINE>Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:</LINE>
        <LINE>Brutus had rather be a villager</LINE>
        <LINE>Than to repute himself a son of Rome</LINE>
        <LINE>Under these hard conditions as this time</LINE>
        <LINE>Is like to lay upon us.</LINE>

        <LINE>The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,</LINE>
        <LINE>And all the rest look like a chidden train:</LINE>
        <LINE>Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero</LINE>
        <LINE>Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes</LINE>

        <LINE>He is a great observer and he looks</LINE>
        <LINE>Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,</LINE>
        <LINE>As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;</LINE>
        <LINE>Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort</LINE>
        <LINE>As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit</LINE>
        <LINE>That could be moved to smile at any thing.</LINE>
        <LINE>Such men as he be never at heart's ease</LINE>
        <LINE>Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,</LINE>
        <LINE>And therefore are they very dangerous.</LINE>
        <LINE>I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd</LINE>
        <LINE>Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.</LINE>
        <LINE>Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,</LINE>

      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Why, there was a crown offered him: and being</LINE>

        <LINE>Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every</LINE>

        <LINE>mine honest neighbours shouted.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>

      </SPEECH>

        <LINE>Why, Antony.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:</LINE>
        <LINE>it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark</LINE>
        <LINE>Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown</LINE>
        <LINE>neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told</LINE>
        <LINE>you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my</LINE>
        <LINE>thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he</LINE>
        <LINE>offered it to him again; then he put it by again:</LINE>
        <LINE>but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his</LINE>
        <LINE>fingers off it. And then he offered it the third</LINE>
        <LINE>time; he put it the third time by: and still as he</LINE>
        <LINE>refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their</LINE>
        <LINE>chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps</LINE>
        <LINE>and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because</LINE>
        <LINE>Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked</LINE>
        <LINE>Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and</LINE>
        <LINE>for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of</LINE>
        <LINE>opening my lips and receiving the bad air.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at</LINE>
        <LINE>mouth, and was speechless.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,</LINE>
        <LINE>And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,</LINE>
        <LINE>Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not</LINE>
        <LINE>clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and</LINE>
        <LINE>displeased them, as they use to do the players in</LINE>
        <LINE>the theatre, I am no true man.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>What said he when he came unto himself?</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the</LINE>
        <LINE>common herd was glad he refused the crown, he</LINE>
        <LINE>plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his</LINE>
        <LINE>throat to cut. An I had been a man of any</LINE>
        <LINE>occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,</LINE>
        <LINE>I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so</LINE>
        <LINE>he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,</LINE>
        <LINE>If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired</LINE>
        <LINE>their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three</LINE>
        <LINE>or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good</LINE>
        <LINE>soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but</LINE>
        <LINE>there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had</LINE>
        <LINE>stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>And after that, he came, thus sad, away?</LINE>

        <LINE>Ay, he spoke Greek.</LINE>

      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>

        <LINE>Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the</LINE>

        <LINE>one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own</LINE>
        <LINE>part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more</LINE>
        <LINE>news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs</LINE>
        <LINE>off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you</LINE>

        <LINE>A common slave--you know him well by sight--</LINE>
        <LINE>Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn</LINE>
        <LINE>Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,</LINE>
        <LINE>Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.</LINE>
        <LINE>Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--</LINE>
        <LINE>Against the Capitol I met a lion,</LINE>
        <LINE>Who glared upon me, and went surly by,</LINE>
        <LINE>Without annoying me: and there were drawn</LINE>
        <LINE>Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,</LINE>
        <LINE>Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw</LINE>
        <LINE>Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.</LINE>
        <LINE>And yesterday the bird of night did sit</LINE>
        <LINE>Even at noon-day upon the market-place,</LINE>
        <LINE>Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies</LINE>
        <LINE>Do so conjointly meet, let not men say</LINE>
        <LINE>'These are their reasons; they are natural;'</LINE>
        <LINE>For, I believe, they are portentous things</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Those that have known the earth so full of faults.</LINE>
        <LINE>For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,</LINE>
        <LINE>Submitting me unto the perilous night,</LINE>
        <LINE>And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,</LINE>
        <LINE>Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;</LINE>
        <LINE>And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open</LINE>
        <LINE>The breast of heaven, I did present myself</LINE>
        <LINE>Even in the aim and very flash of it.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?</LINE>
        <LINE>It is the part of men to fear and tremble,</LINE>

        <LINE>Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life</LINE>
        <LINE>That should be in a Roman you do want,</LINE>
        <LINE>Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze</LINE>
        <LINE>And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,</LINE>
        <LINE>To see the strange impatience of the heavens:</LINE>
        <LINE>But if you would consider the true cause</LINE>
        <LINE>Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,</LINE>
        <LINE>Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,</LINE>
        <LINE>Why old men fool and children calculate,</LINE>
        <LINE>Why all these things change from their ordinance</LINE>
        <LINE>Their natures and preformed faculties</LINE>
        <LINE>To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find</LINE>
        <LINE>That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,</LINE>
        <LINE>To make them instruments of fear and warning</LINE>
        <LINE>Unto some monstrous state.</LINE>
        <LINE>Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man</LINE>
        <LINE>Most like this dreadful night,</LINE>
        <LINE>That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars</LINE>
        <LINE>As doth the lion in the Capitol,</LINE>
        <LINE>A man no mightier than thyself or me</LINE>
        <LINE>In personal action, yet prodigious grown</LINE>

      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Let it be who it is: for Romans now</LINE>
        <LINE>Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;</LINE>
        <LINE>But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,</LINE>
        <LINE>And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;</LINE>
        <LINE>Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow</LINE>
        <LINE>Mean to establish Caesar as a king;</LINE>
        <LINE>And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,</LINE>
        <LINE>In every place, save here in Italy.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>I know where I will wear this dagger then;</LINE>
        <LINE>Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:</LINE>
        <LINE>Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;</LINE>
        <LINE>Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:</LINE>
        <LINE>Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,</LINE>
        <LINE>Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,</LINE>
        <LINE>Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;</LINE>
        <LINE>But life, being weary of these worldly bars,</LINE>
        <LINE>Never lacks power to dismiss itself.</LINE>
        <LINE>If I know this, know all the world besides,</LINE>
        <LINE>That part of tyranny that I do bear</LINE>
        <LINE>I can shake off at pleasure.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <STAGEDIR>Thunder still</STAGEDIR>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>So can I:</LINE>
        <LINE>So every bondman in his own hand bears</LINE>
        <LINE>The power to cancel his captivity.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?</LINE>
        <LINE>Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,</LINE>
        <LINE>But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:</LINE>
        <LINE>He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.</LINE>
        <LINE>Those that with haste will make a mighty fire</LINE>
        <LINE>Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,</LINE>
        <LINE>What rubbish and what offal, when it serves</LINE>
        <LINE>For the base matter to illuminate</LINE>
        <LINE>So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,</LINE>
        <LINE>Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this</LINE>
        <LINE>Before a willing bondman; then I know</LINE>
        <LINE>My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,</LINE>
        <LINE>And dangers are to me indifferent.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>You speak to Casca, and to such a man</LINE>
        <LINE>That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:</LINE>
        <LINE>Be factious for redress of all these griefs,</LINE>
        <LINE>And I will set this foot of mine as far</LINE>

        <LINE>To undergo with me an enterprise</LINE>
        <LINE>Of honourable-dangerous consequence;</LINE>
        <LINE>And I do know, by this, they stay for me</LINE>
        <LINE>In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,</LINE>
        <LINE>There is no stir or walking in the streets;</LINE>
        <LINE>And the complexion of the element</LINE>

        <LINE>But for the general. He would be crown'd:</LINE>
        <LINE>How that might change his nature, there's the question.</LINE>
        <LINE>It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;</LINE>
        <LINE>And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--</LINE>
        <LINE>And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,</LINE>
        <LINE>That at his will he may do danger with.</LINE>
        <LINE>The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins</LINE>
        <LINE>Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,</LINE>
        <LINE>I have not known when his affections sway'd</LINE>
        <LINE>More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,</LINE>

        <LINE>But when he once attains the upmost round.</LINE>
        <LINE>He then unto the ladder turns his back,</LINE>
        <LINE>Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees</LINE>
        <LINE>By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.</LINE>
        <LINE>Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel</LINE>
        <LINE>Will bear no colour for the thing he is,</LINE>
        <LINE>Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,</LINE>
        <LINE>Would run to these and these extremities:</LINE>

        <LINE>They are the faction. O conspiracy,</LINE>
        <LINE>Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,</LINE>
        <LINE>When evils are most free? O, then by day</LINE>
        <LINE>Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough</LINE>
        <LINE>To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;</LINE>
        <LINE>Hide it in smiles and affability:</LINE>
        <LINE>For if thou path, thy native semblance on,</LINE>
        <LINE>Not Erebus itself were dim enough</LINE>
        <LINE>To hide thee from prevention.</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Yes, every man of them, and no man here</LINE>
        <LINE>But honours you; and every one doth wish</LINE>
        <LINE>You had but that opinion of yourself</LINE>

        <LINE>You shall confess that you are both deceived.</LINE>
        <LINE>Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,</LINE>
        <LINE>Which is a great way growing on the south,</LINE>
        <LINE>Weighing the youthful season of the year.</LINE>
        <LINE>Some two months hence up higher toward the north</LINE>

      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>No, not an oath: if not the face of men,</LINE>
        <LINE>The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--</LINE>
        <LINE>If these be motives weak, break off betimes,</LINE>
        <LINE>And every man hence to his idle bed;</LINE>
        <LINE>So let high-sighted tyranny range on,</LINE>
        <LINE>Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,</LINE>
        <LINE>As I am sure they do, bear fire enough</LINE>
        <LINE>To kindle cowards and to steel with valour</LINE>
        <LINE>The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,</LINE>
        <LINE>What need we any spur but our own cause,</LINE>
        <LINE>To prick us to redress? what other bond</LINE>
        <LINE>Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,</LINE>
        <LINE>And will not palter? and what other oath</LINE>
        <LINE>Than honesty to honesty engaged,</LINE>
        <LINE>That this shall be, or we will fall for it?</LINE>
        <LINE>Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,</LINE>
        <LINE>Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls</LINE>
        <LINE>That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear</LINE>
        <LINE>Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain</LINE>
        <LINE>The even virtue of our enterprise,</LINE>
        <LINE>Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,</LINE>
        <LINE>To think that or our cause or our performance</LINE>
        <LINE>Did need an oath; when every drop of blood</LINE>
        <LINE>That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,</LINE>
        <LINE>Is guilty of a several bastardy,</LINE>
        <LINE>If he do break the smallest particle</LINE>

      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>

        <SPEAKER>METELLUS CIMBER</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>O, let us have him, for his silver hairs</LINE>
        <LINE>Will purchase us a good opinion</LINE>
        <LINE>And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:</LINE>
        <LINE>It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;</LINE>
        <LINE>Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,</LINE>
        <LINE>But all be buried in his gravity.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>O, name him not: let us not break with him;</LINE>

      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>

      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,</LINE>
        <LINE>Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,</LINE>
        <LINE>Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him</LINE>
        <LINE>A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,</LINE>
        <LINE>If he improve them, may well stretch so far</LINE>
        <LINE>As to annoy us all: which to prevent,</LINE>
        <LINE>Let Antony and Caesar fall together.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,</LINE>
        <LINE>To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,</LINE>
        <LINE>Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;</LINE>
        <LINE>For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:</LINE>
        <LINE>Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.</LINE>
        <LINE>We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;</LINE>
        <LINE>And in the spirit of men there is no blood:</LINE>
        <LINE>O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,</LINE>
        <LINE>And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,</LINE>
        <LINE>Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,</LINE>
        <LINE>Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;</LINE>
        <LINE>Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,</LINE>
        <LINE>Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:</LINE>
        <LINE>And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,</LINE>
        <LINE>Stir up their servants to an act of rage,</LINE>
        <LINE>And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make</LINE>
        <LINE>Our purpose necessary and not envious:</LINE>
        <LINE>Which so appearing to the common eyes,</LINE>
        <LINE>We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.</LINE>
        <LINE>And for Mark Antony, think not of him;</LINE>
        <LINE>For he can do no more than Caesar's arm</LINE>
        <LINE>When Caesar's head is off.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Yet I fear him;</LINE>
        <LINE>For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:</LINE>
        <LINE>If he love Caesar, all that he can do</LINE>
        <LINE>Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:</LINE>
        <LINE>And that were much he should; for he is given</LINE>
        <LINE>To sports, to wildness and much company.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>TREBONIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>There is no fear in him; let him not die;</LINE>
        <LINE>For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.</LINE>

      <STAGEDIR>Clock strikes</STAGEDIR>

        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Peace! count the clock.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>The clock hath stricken three.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>TREBONIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>'Tis time to part.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>But it is doubtful yet,</LINE>
        <LINE>Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;</LINE>
        <LINE>For he is superstitious grown of late,</LINE>
        <LINE>Quite from the main opinion he held once</LINE>
        <LINE>Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:</LINE>
        <LINE>It may be, these apparent prodigies,</LINE>
        <LINE>The unaccustom'd terror of this night,</LINE>
        <LINE>And the persuasion of his augurers,</LINE>
        <LINE>May hold him from the Capitol to-day.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>DECIUS BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Never fear that: if he be so resolved,</LINE>
        <LINE>I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear</LINE>
        <LINE>That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,</LINE>
        <LINE>And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,</LINE>
        <LINE>Lions with toils and men with flatterers;</LINE>
        <LINE>But when I tell him he hates flatterers,</LINE>
        <LINE>He says he does, being then most flattered.</LINE>
        <LINE>Let me work;</LINE>
        <LINE>For I can give his humour the true bent,</LINE>
        <LINE>And I will bring him to the Capitol.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.</LINE>

        <LINE>Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.</LINE>

        <LINE>Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;</LINE>
        <LINE>Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:</LINE>
        <LINE>Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,</LINE>

        <LINE>Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>PORTIA</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,</LINE>
        <LINE>Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,</LINE>
        <LINE>You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,</LINE>
        <LINE>Musing and sighing, with your arms across,</LINE>
        <LINE>And when I ask'd you what the matter was,</LINE>
        <LINE>You stared upon me with ungentle looks;</LINE>
        <LINE>I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,</LINE>
        <LINE>And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;</LINE>
        <LINE>Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,</LINE>
        <LINE>But, with an angry wafture of your hand,</LINE>
        <LINE>Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;</LINE>
        <LINE>Fearing to strengthen that impatience</LINE>
        <LINE>Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal</LINE>
        <LINE>Hoping it was but an effect of humour,</LINE>
        <LINE>Which sometime hath his hour with every man.</LINE>
        <LINE>It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,</LINE>
        <LINE>And could it work so much upon your shape</LINE>
        <LINE>As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,</LINE>
        <LINE>I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,</LINE>
        <LINE>Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.</LINE>

      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>PORTIA</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Is Brutus sick? and is it physical</LINE>
        <LINE>To walk unbraced and suck up the humours</LINE>
        <LINE>Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,</LINE>
        <LINE>And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,</LINE>
        <LINE>To dare the vile contagion of the night</LINE>
        <LINE>And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air</LINE>
        <LINE>To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;</LINE>
        <LINE>You have some sick offence within your mind,</LINE>
        <LINE>Which, by the right and virtue of my place,</LINE>

        <LINE>Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:</LINE>

        <LINE>And this the bleeding business they have done:</LINE>
        <LINE>Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;</LINE>
        <LINE>And pity to the general wrong of Rome--</LINE>
        <LINE>As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--</LINE>
        <LINE>Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,</LINE>
        <LINE>To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:</LINE>
        <LINE>Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts</LINE>
        <LINE>Of brothers' temper, do receive you in</LINE>

        <LINE>Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?</LINE>
        <LINE>My credit now stands on such slippery ground,</LINE>
        <LINE>That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,</LINE>
        <LINE>Either a coward or a flatterer.</LINE>
        <LINE>That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:</LINE>
        <LINE>If then thy spirit look upon us now,</LINE>
        <LINE>Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,</LINE>
        <LINE>To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,</LINE>
        <LINE>Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,</LINE>
        <LINE>Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?</LINE>
        <LINE>Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,</LINE>
        <LINE>Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,</LINE>
        <LINE>It would become me better than to close</LINE>
        <LINE>In terms of friendship with thine enemies.</LINE>
        <LINE>Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;</LINE>
        <LINE>Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,</LINE>
        <LINE>Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.</LINE>
        <LINE>O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;</LINE>
        <LINE>And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.</LINE>
        <LINE>How like a deer, strucken by many princes,</LINE>

        <LINE>He speaks by leave and by permission,</LINE>

        <LINE>Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my</LINE>
        <LINE>cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me</LINE>
        <LINE>for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that</LINE>
        <LINE>you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and</LINE>
        <LINE>awake your senses, that you may the better judge.</LINE>
        <LINE>If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of</LINE>
        <LINE>Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar</LINE>
        <LINE>was no less than his. If then that friend demand</LINE>
        <LINE>why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:</LINE>
        <LINE>--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved</LINE>
        <LINE>Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and</LINE>
        <LINE>die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live</LINE>
        <LINE>all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;</LINE>
        <LINE>as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was</LINE>
        <LINE>valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I</LINE>
        <LINE>slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his</LINE>
        <LINE>fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his</LINE>
        <LINE>ambition. Who is here so base that would be a</LINE>
        <LINE>bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.</LINE>
        <LINE>Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If</LINE>
        <LINE>any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so</LINE>
        <LINE>vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;</LINE>
        <LINE>for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.</LINE>

        <LINE>But Brutus says he was ambitious;</LINE>
        <LINE>And Brutus is an honourable man.</LINE>
        <LINE>He hath brought many captives home to Rome</LINE>
        <LINE>Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:</LINE>
        <LINE>Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?</LINE>
        <LINE>When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:</LINE>
        <LINE>Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:</LINE>
        <LINE>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</LINE>
        <LINE>And Brutus is an honourable man.</LINE>
        <LINE>You all did see that on the Lupercal</LINE>
        <LINE>I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</LINE>
        <LINE>Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?</LINE>
        <LINE>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</LINE>
        <LINE>And, sure, he is an honourable man.</LINE>
        <LINE>I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,</LINE>
        <LINE>But here I am to speak what I do know.</LINE>
        <LINE>You all did love him once, not without cause:</LINE>
        <LINE>What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?</LINE>
        <LINE>O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,</LINE>
        <LINE>And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;</LINE>
        <LINE>My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,</LINE>
        <LINE>And I must pause till it come back to me.</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>Fourth Citizen</SPEAKER>

        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>But yesterday the word of Caesar might</LINE>

        <LINE>And none so poor to do him reverence.</LINE>
        <LINE>O masters, if I were disposed to stir</LINE>
        <LINE>Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,</LINE>
        <LINE>I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,</LINE>
        <LINE>Who, you all know, are honourable men:</LINE>
        <LINE>I will not do them wrong; I rather choose</LINE>
        <LINE>To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,</LINE>
        <LINE>Than I will wrong such honourable men.</LINE>
        <LINE>But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;</LINE>
        <LINE>I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:</LINE>
        <LINE>Let but the commons hear this testament--</LINE>
        <LINE>Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--</LINE>
        <LINE>And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds</LINE>
        <LINE>And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,</LINE>
        <LINE>Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,</LINE>
        <LINE>And, dying, mention it within their wills,</LINE>
        <LINE>Bequeathing it as a rich legacy</LINE>

        <LINE>You all do know this mantle: I remember</LINE>
        <LINE>The first time ever Caesar put it on;</LINE>
        <LINE>'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,</LINE>
        <LINE>That day he overcame the Nervii:</LINE>
        <LINE>Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:</LINE>
        <LINE>See what a rent the envious Casca made:</LINE>
        <LINE>Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;</LINE>
        <LINE>And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,</LINE>
        <LINE>Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,</LINE>
        <LINE>As rushing out of doors, to be resolved</LINE>
        <LINE>If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;</LINE>
        <LINE>For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:</LINE>
        <LINE>Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!</LINE>
        <LINE>This was the most unkindest cut of all;</LINE>
        <LINE>For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,</LINE>
        <LINE>Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,</LINE>
        <LINE>Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;</LINE>
        <LINE>And, in his mantle muffling up his face,</LINE>
        <LINE>Even at the base of Pompey's statua,</LINE>
        <LINE>Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.</LINE>
        <LINE>O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!</LINE>
        <LINE>Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,</LINE>
        <LINE>Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.</LINE>
        <LINE>O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel</LINE>
        <LINE>The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.</LINE>
        <LINE>Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold</LINE>
        <LINE>Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,</LINE>

        <LINE>If we do lose this battle, then is this</LINE>
        <LINE>The very last time we shall speak together:</LINE>
        <LINE>What are you then determined to do?</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Even by the rule of that philosophy</LINE>
        <LINE>By which I did blame Cato for the death</LINE>
        <LINE>Which he did give himself, I know not how,</LINE>
        <LINE>But I do find it cowardly and vile,</LINE>
        <LINE>For fear of what might fall, so to prevent</LINE>
        <LINE>The time of life: arming myself with patience</LINE>
        <LINE>To stay the providence of some high powers</LINE>
        <LINE>That govern us below.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Then, if we lose this battle,</LINE>
        <LINE>You are contented to be led in triumph</LINE>
        <LINE>Thorough the streets of Rome?</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,</LINE>
        <LINE>That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;</LINE>
        <LINE>He bears too great a mind. But this same day</LINE>
        <LINE>Must end that work the ides of March begun;</LINE>
        <LINE>And whether we shall meet again I know not.</LINE>
        <LINE>Therefore our everlasting farewell take:</LINE>
        <LINE>For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!</LINE>
        <LINE>If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;</LINE>
        <LINE>If not, why then, this parting was well made.</LINE>

      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>

        <LINE>Why, this, Volumnius:</LINE>
        <LINE>The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me</LINE>
        <LINE>Two several times by night; at Sardis once,</LINE>
        <LINE>And, this last night, here in Philippi fields:</LINE>

        <LINE>Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.</LINE>
        <LINE>Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;</LINE>
        <LINE>Our enemies have beat us to the pit:</LINE>
        <STAGEDIR>Low alarums</STAGEDIR>
        <LINE>It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,</LINE>
        <LINE>Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,</LINE>
        <LINE>Thou know'st that we two went to school together:</LINE>
        <LINE>Even for that our love of old, I prithee,</LINE>
        <LINE>Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>

        <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.</LINE>
        <LINE>Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;</LINE>
        <LINE>Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,</LINE>
        <LINE>My heart doth joy that yet in all my life</LINE>
        <LINE>I found no man but he was true to me.</LINE>
        <LINE>I shall have glory by this losing day</LINE>
        <LINE>More than Octavius and Mark Antony</LINE>
        <LINE>By this vile conquest shall attain unto.</LINE>
        <LINE>So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue</LINE>
        <LINE>Hath almost ended his life's history:</LINE>
        <LINE>Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,</LINE>
        <LINE>That have but labour'd to attain this hour.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>

        <LINE>I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:</LINE>
        <LINE>Thou art a fellow of a good respect;</LINE>
        <LINE>Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:</LINE>
        <LINE>Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,</LINE>
        <LINE>While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>STRATO</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.</LINE>

        <LINE>Farewell, good Strato.</LINE>
        <STAGEDIR>Runs on his sword</STAGEDIR>
        <LINE>Caesar, now be still:</LINE>
        <LINE>I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <STAGEDIR>Dies</STAGEDIR>
      <STAGEDIR>Alarum. Retreat. Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, MESSALA,
LUCILIUS, and the army</STAGEDIR>

      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>STRATO</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:</LINE>
        <LINE>The conquerors can but make a fire of him;</LINE>
        <LINE>For Brutus only overcame himself,</LINE>
        <LINE>And no man else hath honour by his death.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>LUCILIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,</LINE>
        <LINE>That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.</LINE>
        <LINE>Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>STRATO</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Do so, good Messala.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>How died my master, Strato?</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>STRATO</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>I held the sword, and he did run on it.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Octavius, then take him to follow thee,</LINE>
        <LINE>That did the latest service to my master.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>This was the noblest Roman of them all:</LINE>
        <LINE>All the conspirators save only he</LINE>
        <LINE>Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;</LINE>
        <LINE>He only, in a general honest thought</LINE>
        <LINE>And common good to all, made one of them.</LINE>
        <LINE>His life was gentle, and the elements</LINE>
        <LINE>So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up</LINE>
        <LINE>And say to all the world 'This was a man!'</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>According to his virtue let us use him,</LINE>
        <LINE>With all respect and rites of burial.</LINE>
        <LINE>Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,</LINE>
        <LINE>Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.</LINE>
        <LINE>So call the field to rest; and let's away,</LINE>
        <LINE>To part the glories of this happy day.</LINE>

    <STAGEDIR>Enter FLAVIUS, MARULLUS, and certain Commoners</STAGEDIR>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>FLAVIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:</LINE>
      <LINE>Is this a holiday? what! know you not,</LINE>
      <LINE>Being mechanical, you ought not walk</LINE>
      <LINE>Upon a labouring day without the sign</LINE>
      <LINE>Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>First Commoner</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Why, sir, a carpenter.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?</LINE>
      <LINE>What dost thou with thy best apparel on?</LINE>
      <LINE>You, sir, what trade are you?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,</LINE>
      <LINE>as you would say, a cobbler.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>But what trade art thou? answer me directly.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe</LINE>
      <LINE>conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,</LINE>
      <LINE>if you be out, sir, I can mend you.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Why, sir, cobble you.</LINE>

      <SPEAKER>FLAVIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Thou art a cobbler, art thou?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I</LINE>
      <LINE>meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's</LINE>
      <LINE>matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon</LINE>
      <LINE>to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I</LINE>
      <LINE>recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon</LINE>
      <LINE>neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>FLAVIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>But wherefore art not in thy shop today?</LINE>
      <LINE>Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself</LINE>
      <LINE>into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,</LINE>
      <LINE>to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?</LINE>
      <LINE>What tributaries follow him to Rome,</LINE>
      <LINE>To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?</LINE>
      <LINE>You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!</LINE>
      <LINE>O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,</LINE>
      <LINE>Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft</LINE>
      <LINE>Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,</LINE>
      <LINE>To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,</LINE>
      <LINE>Your infants in your arms, and there have sat</LINE>
      <LINE>The livelong day, with patient expectation,</LINE>
      <LINE>To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:</LINE>
      <LINE>And when you saw his chariot but appear,</LINE>
      <LINE>Have you not made an universal shout,</LINE>
      <LINE>That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,</LINE>
      <LINE>To hear the replication of your sounds</LINE>
      <LINE>Made in her concave shores?</LINE>
      <LINE>And do you now put on your best attire?</LINE>
      <LINE>And do you now cull out a holiday?</LINE>
      <LINE>And do you now strew flowers in his way</LINE>
      <LINE>That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!</LINE>
      <LINE>Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,</LINE>
      <LINE>Pray to the gods to intermit the plague</LINE>
      <LINE>That needs must light on this ingratitude.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>FLAVIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,</LINE>
      <LINE>Assemble all the poor men of your sort;</LINE>
      <LINE>Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears</LINE>
      <LINE>Into the channel, till the lowest stream</LINE>
      <LINE>Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.</LINE>
      <STAGEDIR>Exeunt all the Commoners</STAGEDIR>
      <LINE>See whether their basest metal be not moved;</LINE>
      <LINE>They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.</LINE>
      <LINE>Go you down that way towards the Capitol;</LINE>
      <LINE>This way will I disrobe the images,</LINE>
      <LINE>If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>May we do so?</LINE>
      <LINE>You know it is the feast of Lupercal.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>FLAVIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>It is no matter; let no images</LINE>
      <LINE>Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,</LINE>
      <LINE>And drive away the vulgar from the streets:</LINE>
      <LINE>So do you too, where you perceive them thick.</LINE>
      <LINE>These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing</LINE>
      <LINE>Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,</LINE>
      <LINE>Who else would soar above the view of men</LINE>
      <LINE>And keep us all in servile fearfulness.</LINE>

    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Will you go see the order of the course?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>

      <LINE>Not I.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>I pray you, do.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>I am not gamesome: I do lack some part</LINE>
      <LINE>Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.</LINE>
      <LINE>Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;</LINE>
      <LINE>I'll leave you.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Brutus, I do observe you now of late:</LINE>
      <LINE>I have not from your eyes that gentleness</LINE>
      <LINE>And show of love as I was wont to have:</LINE>
      <LINE>You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand</LINE>
      <LINE>Over your friend that loves you.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Cassius,</LINE>
      <LINE>Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,</LINE>
      <LINE>I turn the trouble of my countenance</LINE>
      <LINE>Merely upon myself. Vexed I am</LINE>
      <LINE>Of late with passions of some difference,</LINE>
      <LINE>Conceptions only proper to myself,</LINE>
      <LINE>Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;</LINE>
      <LINE>But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--</LINE>
      <LINE>Among which number, Cassius, be you one--</LINE>
      <LINE>Nor construe any further my neglect,</LINE>
      <LINE>Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,</LINE>
      <LINE>Forgets the shows of love to other men.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;</LINE>
      <LINE>By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried</LINE>
      <LINE>Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.</LINE>
      <LINE>Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,</LINE>
      <LINE>But by reflection, by some other things.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>'Tis just:</LINE>
      <LINE>And it is very much lamented, Brutus,</LINE>
      <LINE>That you have no such mirrors as will turn</LINE>
      <LINE>Your hidden worthiness into your eye,</LINE>
      <LINE>That you might see your shadow. I have heard,</LINE>
      <LINE>Where many of the best respect in Rome,</LINE>
      <LINE>Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus</LINE>
      <LINE>And groaning underneath this age's yoke,</LINE>
      <LINE>Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,</LINE>
      <LINE>That you would have me seek into myself</LINE>
      <LINE>For that which is not in me?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:</LINE>
      <LINE>And since you know you cannot see yourself</LINE>
      <LINE>So well as by reflection, I, your glass,</LINE>
      <LINE>Will modestly discover to yourself</LINE>
      <LINE>That of yourself which you yet know not of.</LINE>
      <LINE>And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:</LINE>
      <LINE>Were I a common laugher, or did use</LINE>
      <LINE>To stale with ordinary oaths my love</LINE>
      <LINE>To every new protester; if you know</LINE>
      <LINE>That I do fawn on men and hug them hard</LINE>
      <LINE>And after scandal them, or if you know</LINE>
      <LINE>That I profess myself in banqueting</LINE>
      <LINE>To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <STAGEDIR>Flourish, and shout</STAGEDIR>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>What means this shouting? I do fear, the people</LINE>
      <LINE>Choose Caesar for their king.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Ay, do you fear it?</LINE>
      <LINE>Then must I think you would not have it so.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.</LINE>
      <LINE>But wherefore do you hold me here so long?</LINE>
      <LINE>What is it that you would impart to me?</LINE>
      <LINE>If it be aught toward the general good,</LINE>
      <LINE>Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,</LINE>
      <LINE>And I will look on both indifferently,</LINE>
      <LINE>For let the gods so speed me as I love</LINE>
      <LINE>The name of honour more than I fear death.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</LINE>
      <LINE>As well as I do know your outward favour.</LINE>
      <LINE>Well, honour is the subject of my story.</LINE>
      <LINE>I cannot tell what you and other men</LINE>
      <LINE>Think of this life; but, for my single self,</LINE>
      <LINE>I had as lief not be as live to be</LINE>
      <LINE>In awe of such a thing as I myself.</LINE>
      <LINE>I was born free as Caesar; so were you:</LINE>
      <LINE>We both have fed as well, and we can both</LINE>
      <LINE>Endure the winter's cold as well as he:</LINE>
      <LINE>For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</LINE>
      <LINE>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</LINE>
      <LINE>Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now</LINE>
      <LINE>Leap in with me into this angry flood,</LINE>
      <LINE>And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,</LINE>
      <LINE>Accoutred as I was, I plunged in</LINE>
      <LINE>And bade him follow; so indeed he did.</LINE>
      <LINE>The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it</LINE>
      <LINE>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</LINE>
      <LINE>And stemming it with hearts of controversy;</LINE>
      <LINE>But ere we could arrive the point proposed,</LINE>
      <LINE>Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'</LINE>
      <LINE>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</LINE>
      <LINE>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</LINE>
      <LINE>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</LINE>
      <LINE>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</LINE>
      <LINE>Is now become a god, and Cassius is</LINE>
      <LINE>A wretched creature and must bend his body,</LINE>
      <LINE>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</LINE>
      <LINE>He had a fever when he was in Spain,</LINE>
      <LINE>And when the fit was on him, I did mark</LINE>
      <LINE>How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;</LINE>
      <LINE>His coward lips did from their colour fly,</LINE>
      <LINE>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</LINE>
      <LINE>Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:</LINE>
      <LINE>Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans</LINE>
      <LINE>Mark him and write his speeches in their books,</LINE>
      <LINE>Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'</LINE>
      <LINE>As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me</LINE>
      <LINE>A man of such a feeble temper should</LINE>
      <LINE>So get the start of the majestic world</LINE>
      <LINE>And bear the palm alone.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <STAGEDIR>Shout. Flourish</STAGEDIR>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Another general shout!</LINE>
      <LINE>I do believe that these applauses are</LINE>
      <LINE>For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</LINE>
      <LINE>Like a Colossus, and we petty men</LINE>
      <LINE>Walk under his huge legs and peep about</LINE>
      <LINE>To find ourselves dishonourable graves.</LINE>
      <LINE>Men at some time are masters of their fates:</LINE>
      <LINE>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</LINE>
      <LINE>But in ourselves, that we are underlings.</LINE>
      <LINE>Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?</LINE>
      <LINE>Why should that name be sounded more than yours?</LINE>
      <LINE>Write them together, yours is as fair a name;</LINE>
      <LINE>Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;</LINE>
      <LINE>Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,</LINE>
      <LINE>Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.</LINE>
      <LINE>Now, in the names of all the gods at once,</LINE>
      <LINE>Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,</LINE>
      <LINE>That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!</LINE>
      <LINE>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!</LINE>
      <LINE>When went there by an age, since the great flood,</LINE>
      <LINE>But it was famed with more than with one man?</LINE>
      <LINE>When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,</LINE>
      <LINE>That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?</LINE>
      <LINE>Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,</LINE>
      <LINE>When there is in it but one only man.</LINE>
      <LINE>O, you and I have heard our fathers say,</LINE>
      <LINE>There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd</LINE>
      <LINE>The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome</LINE>
      <LINE>As easily as a king.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;</LINE>
      <LINE>What you would work me to, I have some aim:</LINE>
      <LINE>How I have thought of this and of these times,</LINE>
      <LINE>I shall recount hereafter; for this present,</LINE>
      <LINE>I would not, so with love I might entreat you,</LINE>
      <LINE>Be any further moved. What you have said</LINE>
      <LINE>I will consider; what you have to say</LINE>
      <LINE>I will with patience hear, and find a time</LINE>
      <LINE>Both meet to hear and answer such high things.</LINE>
      <LINE>Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:</LINE>
      <LINE>Brutus had rather be a villager</LINE>
      <LINE>Than to repute himself a son of Rome</LINE>
      <LINE>Under these hard conditions as this time</LINE>
      <LINE>Is like to lay upon us.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>I am glad that my weak words</LINE>
      <LINE>Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>The games are done and Caesar is returning.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;</LINE>
      <LINE>And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you</LINE>
      <LINE>What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <STAGEDIR>Re-enter CAESAR and his Train</STAGEDIR>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,</LINE>
      <LINE>The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,</LINE>
      <LINE>And all the rest look like a chidden train:</LINE>
      <LINE>Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero</LINE>
      <LINE>Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes</LINE>
      <LINE>As we have seen him in the Capitol,</LINE>
      <LINE>Being cross'd in conference by some senators.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Casca will tell us what the matter is.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CAESAR</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Antonius!</LINE>

      <LINE>Caesar?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CAESAR</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Let me have men about me that are fat;</LINE>
      <LINE>Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:</LINE>
      <LINE>Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;</LINE>
      <LINE>He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;</LINE>
      <LINE>He is a noble Roman and well given.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CAESAR</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:</LINE>
      <LINE>Yet if my name were liable to fear,</LINE>
      <LINE>I do not know the man I should avoid</LINE>
      <LINE>So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;</LINE>
      <LINE>He is a great observer and he looks</LINE>
      <LINE>Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,</LINE>
      <LINE>As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;</LINE>
      <LINE>Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort</LINE>
      <LINE>As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit</LINE>
      <LINE>That could be moved to smile at any thing.</LINE>
      <LINE>Such men as he be never at heart's ease</LINE>
      <LINE>Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,</LINE>
      <LINE>And therefore are they very dangerous.</LINE>
      <LINE>I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd</LINE>
      <LINE>Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.</LINE>
      <LINE>Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,</LINE>
      <LINE>And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <STAGEDIR>Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA</STAGEDIR>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,</LINE>
      <LINE>That Caesar looks so sad.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Why, you were with him, were you not?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>

    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Why, there was a crown offered him: and being</LINE>
      <LINE>offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,</LINE>
      <LINE>thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>What was the second noise for?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>

      <LINE>Why, for that too.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Why, for that too.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Was the crown offered him thrice?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every</LINE>
      <LINE>time gentler than other, and at every putting-by</LINE>
      <LINE>mine honest neighbours shouted.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Who offered him the crown?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Why, Antony.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:</LINE>
      <LINE>it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark</LINE>
      <LINE>Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown</LINE>
      <LINE>neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told</LINE>
      <LINE>you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my</LINE>
      <LINE>thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he</LINE>
      <LINE>offered it to him again; then he put it by again:</LINE>
      <LINE>but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his</LINE>
      <LINE>fingers off it. And then he offered it the third</LINE>
      <LINE>time; he put it the third time by: and still as he</LINE>
      <LINE>refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their</LINE>
      <LINE>chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps</LINE>
      <LINE>and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because</LINE>
      <LINE>Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked</LINE>
      <LINE>Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and</LINE>
      <LINE>for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of</LINE>
      <LINE>opening my lips and receiving the bad air.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at</LINE>
      <LINE>mouth, and was speechless.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,</LINE>
      <LINE>And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,</LINE>
      <LINE>Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not</LINE>
      <LINE>clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and</LINE>
      <LINE>displeased them, as they use to do the players in</LINE>
      <LINE>the theatre, I am no true man.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>What said he when he came unto himself?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the</LINE>
      <LINE>common herd was glad he refused the crown, he</LINE>
      <LINE>plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his</LINE>
      <LINE>throat to cut. An I had been a man of any</LINE>
      <LINE>occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,</LINE>
      <LINE>I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so</LINE>
      <LINE>he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,</LINE>
      <LINE>If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired</LINE>
      <LINE>their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three</LINE>
      <LINE>or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good</LINE>
      <LINE>soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but</LINE>
      <LINE>there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had</LINE>
      <LINE>stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>And after that, he came, thus sad, away?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Ay.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Did Cicero say any thing?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Ay, he spoke Greek.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>To what effect?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the</LINE>
      <LINE>face again: but those that understood him smiled at</LINE>
      <LINE>one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own</LINE>
      <LINE>part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more</LINE>
      <LINE>news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs</LINE>
      <LINE>off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you</LINE>
      <LINE>well. There was more foolery yet, if I could</LINE>
      <LINE>remember it.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?</LINE>

      <LINE>Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth</LINE>
      <LINE>Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,</LINE>
      <LINE>I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds</LINE>
      <LINE>Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen</LINE>
      <LINE>The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,</LINE>
      <LINE>To be exalted with the threatening clouds:</LINE>
      <LINE>But never till to-night, never till now,</LINE>
      <LINE>Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.</LINE>
      <LINE>Either there is a civil strife in heaven,</LINE>

      <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>A common slave--you know him well by sight--</LINE>
      <LINE>Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn</LINE>
      <LINE>Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,</LINE>
      <LINE>Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.</LINE>
      <LINE>Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--</LINE>
      <LINE>Against the Capitol I met a lion,</LINE>
      <LINE>Who glared upon me, and went surly by,</LINE>
      <LINE>Without annoying me: and there were drawn</LINE>
      <LINE>Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,</LINE>
      <LINE>Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw</LINE>
      <LINE>Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.</LINE>
      <LINE>And yesterday the bird of night did sit</LINE>
      <LINE>Even at noon-day upon the market-place,</LINE>
      <LINE>Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies</LINE>
      <LINE>Do so conjointly meet, let not men say</LINE>
      <LINE>'These are their reasons; they are natural;'</LINE>

      <LINE>Who ever knew the heavens menace so?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Those that have known the earth so full of faults.</LINE>
      <LINE>For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,</LINE>
      <LINE>Submitting me unto the perilous night,</LINE>
      <LINE>And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,</LINE>
      <LINE>Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;</LINE>
      <LINE>And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open</LINE>
      <LINE>The breast of heaven, I did present myself</LINE>
      <LINE>Even in the aim and very flash of it.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?</LINE>
      <LINE>It is the part of men to fear and tremble,</LINE>
      <LINE>When the most mighty gods by tokens send</LINE>
      <LINE>Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life</LINE>
      <LINE>That should be in a Roman you do want,</LINE>
      <LINE>Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze</LINE>
      <LINE>And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,</LINE>
      <LINE>To see the strange impatience of the heavens:</LINE>
      <LINE>But if you would consider the true cause</LINE>
      <LINE>Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,</LINE>
      <LINE>Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,</LINE>
      <LINE>Why old men fool and children calculate,</LINE>
      <LINE>Why all these things change from their ordinance</LINE>
      <LINE>Their natures and preformed faculties</LINE>
      <LINE>To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find</LINE>
      <LINE>That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,</LINE>
      <LINE>To make them instruments of fear and warning</LINE>
      <LINE>Unto some monstrous state.</LINE>
      <LINE>Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man</LINE>
      <LINE>Most like this dreadful night,</LINE>
      <LINE>That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars</LINE>
      <LINE>As doth the lion in the Capitol,</LINE>
      <LINE>A man no mightier than thyself or me</LINE>

      <LINE>But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,</LINE>
      <LINE>And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;</LINE>
      <LINE>Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow</LINE>
      <LINE>Mean to establish Caesar as a king;</LINE>
      <LINE>And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,</LINE>
      <LINE>In every place, save here in Italy.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>I know where I will wear this dagger then;</LINE>
      <LINE>Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:</LINE>
      <LINE>Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;</LINE>
      <LINE>Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:</LINE>
      <LINE>Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,</LINE>
      <LINE>Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,</LINE>
      <LINE>Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;</LINE>
      <LINE>But life, being weary of these worldly bars,</LINE>
      <LINE>Never lacks power to dismiss itself.</LINE>
      <LINE>If I know this, know all the world besides,</LINE>
      <LINE>That part of tyranny that I do bear</LINE>
      <LINE>I can shake off at pleasure.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <STAGEDIR>Thunder still</STAGEDIR>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>So can I:</LINE>
      <LINE>So every bondman in his own hand bears</LINE>
      <LINE>The power to cancel his captivity.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?</LINE>
      <LINE>Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,</LINE>
      <LINE>But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:</LINE>
      <LINE>He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.</LINE>
      <LINE>Those that with haste will make a mighty fire</LINE>
      <LINE>Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,</LINE>
      <LINE>What rubbish and what offal, when it serves</LINE>
      <LINE>For the base matter to illuminate</LINE>
      <LINE>So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,</LINE>
      <LINE>Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this</LINE>
      <LINE>Before a willing bondman; then I know</LINE>
      <LINE>My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,</LINE>
      <LINE>And dangers are to me indifferent.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>You speak to Casca, and to such a man</LINE>
      <LINE>That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:</LINE>
      <LINE>Be factious for redress of all these griefs,</LINE>
      <LINE>And I will set this foot of mine as far</LINE>
      <LINE>As who goes farthest.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>There's a bargain made.</LINE>
      <LINE>Now know you, Casca, I have moved already</LINE>
      <LINE>Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans</LINE>
      <LINE>To undergo with me an enterprise</LINE>
      <LINE>Of honourable-dangerous consequence;</LINE>
      <LINE>And I do know, by this, they stay for me</LINE>
      <LINE>In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,</LINE>

      <LINE>And the complexion of the element</LINE>

      <LINE>It must be by his death: and for my part,</LINE>
      <LINE>I know no personal cause to spurn at him,</LINE>
      <LINE>But for the general. He would be crown'd:</LINE>
      <LINE>How that might change his nature, there's the question.</LINE>
      <LINE>It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;</LINE>

      <LINE>And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,</LINE>

      <LINE>The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins</LINE>
      <LINE>Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,</LINE>
      <LINE>I have not known when his affections sway'd</LINE>

      <LINE>He then unto the ladder turns his back,</LINE>
      <LINE>Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees</LINE>
      <LINE>By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.</LINE>
      <LINE>Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel</LINE>
      <LINE>Will bear no colour for the thing he is,</LINE>
      <LINE>Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,</LINE>
      <LINE>Would run to these and these extremities:</LINE>
      <LINE>And therefore think him as a serpent's egg</LINE>

      <LINE>No, not an oath: if not the face of men,</LINE>

      <LINE>Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,</LINE>

      <LINE>Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,</LINE>
      <LINE>Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,</LINE>
      <LINE>Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him</LINE>
      <LINE>A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,</LINE>
      <LINE>If he improve them, may well stretch so far</LINE>
      <LINE>As to annoy us all: which to prevent,</LINE>
      <LINE>Let Antony and Caesar fall together.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,</LINE>
      <LINE>To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,</LINE>
      <LINE>Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;</LINE>
      <LINE>For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:</LINE>
      <LINE>Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.</LINE>
      <LINE>We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;</LINE>
      <LINE>And in the spirit of men there is no blood:</LINE>
      <LINE>O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,</LINE>
      <LINE>And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,</LINE>
      <LINE>Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,</LINE>
      <LINE>Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;</LINE>
      <LINE>Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,</LINE>
      <LINE>Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:</LINE>
      <LINE>And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,</LINE>
      <LINE>Stir up their servants to an act of rage,</LINE>
      <LINE>And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make</LINE>
      <LINE>Our purpose necessary and not envious:</LINE>
      <LINE>Which so appearing to the common eyes,</LINE>
      <LINE>We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.</LINE>
      <LINE>And for Mark Antony, think not of him;</LINE>
      <LINE>For he can do no more than Caesar's arm</LINE>
      <LINE>When Caesar's head is off.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Yet I fear him;</LINE>

    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:</LINE>
      <LINE>If he love Caesar, all that he can do</LINE>
      <LINE>Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:</LINE>
      <LINE>And that were much he should; for he is given</LINE>
      <LINE>To sports, to wildness and much company.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>TREBONIUS</SPEAKER>

      <LINE>But it is doubtful yet,</LINE>
      <LINE>Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;</LINE>
      <LINE>For he is superstitious grown of late,</LINE>
      <LINE>Quite from the main opinion he held once</LINE>
      <LINE>Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:</LINE>
      <LINE>It may be, these apparent prodigies,</LINE>
      <LINE>The unaccustom'd terror of this night,</LINE>
      <LINE>And the persuasion of his augurers,</LINE>
      <LINE>May hold him from the Capitol to-day.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>DECIUS BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Never fear that: if he be so resolved,</LINE>
      <LINE>I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear</LINE>
      <LINE>That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,</LINE>
      <LINE>And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,</LINE>
      <LINE>Lions with toils and men with flatterers;</LINE>
      <LINE>But when I tell him he hates flatterers,</LINE>
      <LINE>He says he does, being then most flattered.</LINE>
      <LINE>Let me work;</LINE>
      <LINE>For I can give his humour the true bent,</LINE>
      <LINE>And I will bring him to the Capitol.</LINE>

    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>PORTIA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,</LINE>
      <LINE>Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,</LINE>
      <LINE>You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,</LINE>
      <LINE>Musing and sighing, with your arms across,</LINE>
      <LINE>And when I ask'd you what the matter was,</LINE>
      <LINE>You stared upon me with ungentle looks;</LINE>
      <LINE>I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,</LINE>
      <LINE>And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;</LINE>
      <LINE>Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,</LINE>
      <LINE>But, with an angry wafture of your hand,</LINE>
      <LINE>Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;</LINE>
      <LINE>Fearing to strengthen that impatience</LINE>
      <LINE>Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal</LINE>
      <LINE>Hoping it was but an effect of humour,</LINE>
      <LINE>Which sometime hath his hour with every man.</LINE>
      <LINE>It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,</LINE>
      <LINE>And could it work so much upon your shape</LINE>

      <LINE>Is Brutus sick? and is it physical</LINE>
      <LINE>To walk unbraced and suck up the humours</LINE>
      <LINE>Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,</LINE>

      <LINE>To dare the vile contagion of the night</LINE>
      <LINE>And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air</LINE>
      <LINE>To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;</LINE>
      <LINE>You have some sick offence within your mind,</LINE>
      <LINE>Which, by the right and virtue of my place,</LINE>
      <LINE>I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,</LINE>

      <LINE>That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,</LINE>
      <LINE>Why you are heavy, and what men to-night</LINE>

      <LINE>Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:</LINE>
      <LINE>Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;</LINE>
      <LINE>Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him and loved him.</LINE>
      <LINE>If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony</LINE>

      <LINE>How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,</LINE>
      <LINE>Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead</LINE>

      <LINE>Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich</LINE>
      <LINE>With the most noble blood of all this world.</LINE>
      <LINE>I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,</LINE>
      <LINE>Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,</LINE>
      <LINE>Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,</LINE>
      <LINE>I shall not find myself so apt to die:</LINE>

      <LINE>As, by our hands and this our present act,</LINE>
      <LINE>You see we do, yet see you but our hands</LINE>
      <LINE>And this the bleeding business they have done:</LINE>
      <LINE>Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;</LINE>
      <LINE>And pity to the general wrong of Rome--</LINE>
      <LINE>As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--</LINE>
      <LINE>Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,</LINE>
      <LINE>To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:</LINE>
      <LINE>Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts</LINE>
      <LINE>Of brothers' temper, do receive you in</LINE>

      <LINE>Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;</LINE>
      <LINE>Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;</LINE>

      <LINE>Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?</LINE>
      <LINE>My credit now stands on such slippery ground,</LINE>
      <LINE>That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,</LINE>
      <LINE>Either a coward or a flatterer.</LINE>
      <LINE>That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:</LINE>
      <LINE>If then thy spirit look upon us now,</LINE>
      <LINE>Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,</LINE>
      <LINE>To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,</LINE>
      <LINE>Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,</LINE>
      <LINE>Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?</LINE>
      <LINE>Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,</LINE>
      <LINE>Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,</LINE>
      <LINE>It would become me better than to close</LINE>
      <LINE>In terms of friendship with thine enemies.</LINE>
      <LINE>Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;</LINE>
      <LINE>Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,</LINE>
      <LINE>Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.</LINE>
      <LINE>O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;</LINE>
      <LINE>And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.</LINE>
      <LINE>How like a deer, strucken by many princes,</LINE>

      <LINE>Pardon me, Caius Cassius:</LINE>

    <SPEECH>

      <LINE>By your pardon;</LINE>

      <LINE>What Antony shall speak, I will protest</LINE>
      <LINE>He speaks by leave and by permission,</LINE>

      <LINE>Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--</LINE>
      <LINE>Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,</LINE>
      <LINE>To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--</LINE>
      <LINE>A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;</LINE>
      <LINE>Domestic fury and fierce civil strife</LINE>

      <LINE>Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;</LINE>
      <LINE>All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:</LINE>
      <LINE>And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,</LINE>
      <LINE>With Ate by his side come hot from hell,</LINE>
      <LINE>Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice</LINE>
      <LINE>Cry  'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;</LINE>

    <TITLE>SCENE II.  The Forum.</TITLE>

      <LINE>We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.</LINE>

    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>I will hear Brutus speak.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,</LINE>
      <LINE>When severally we hear them rendered.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <STAGEDIR>Exit CASSIUS, with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS
goes into the pulpit</STAGEDIR>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Be patient till the last.</LINE>
      <LINE>Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my</LINE>
      <LINE>cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me</LINE>
      <LINE>for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that</LINE>
      <LINE>you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and</LINE>
      <LINE>awake your senses, that you may the better judge.</LINE>
      <LINE>If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of</LINE>
      <LINE>Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar</LINE>
      <LINE>was no less than his. If then that friend demand</LINE>
      <LINE>why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:</LINE>
      <LINE>--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved</LINE>
      <LINE>Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and</LINE>
      <LINE>die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live</LINE>
      <LINE>all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;</LINE>
      <LINE>as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was</LINE>
      <LINE>valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I</LINE>
      <LINE>slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his</LINE>
      <LINE>fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his</LINE>
      <LINE>ambition. Who is here so base that would be a</LINE>
      <LINE>bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.</LINE>
      <LINE>Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If</LINE>
      <LINE>any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so</LINE>
      <LINE>vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;</LINE>
      <LINE>for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>All</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>None, Brutus, none.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Then none have I offended. I have done no more to</LINE>
      <LINE>Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of</LINE>
      <LINE>his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not</LINE>
      <LINE>extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences</LINE>
      <LINE>enforced, for which he suffered death.</LINE>
      <STAGEDIR>Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body</STAGEDIR>
      <LINE>Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,</LINE>
      <LINE>though he had no hand in his death, shall receive</LINE>
      <LINE>the benefit of his dying, a place in the</LINE>
      <LINE>commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this</LINE>
      <LINE>I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the</LINE>
      <LINE>good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,</LINE>
      <LINE>when it shall please my country to need my death.</LINE>

      <LINE>This Caesar was a tyrant.</LINE>

      <SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Nay, that's certain:</LINE>

      <SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.</LINE>

      <LINE>You gentle Romans,--</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>Citizens</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Peace, ho! let us hear him.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;</LINE>
      <LINE>I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.</LINE>
      <LINE>The evil that men do lives after them;</LINE>
      <LINE>The good is oft interred with their bones;</LINE>
      <LINE>So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus</LINE>
      <LINE>Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:</LINE>
      <LINE>If it were so, it was a grievous fault,</LINE>
      <LINE>And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.</LINE>
      <LINE>Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--</LINE>
      <LINE>For Brutus is an honourable man;</LINE>
      <LINE>So are they all, all honourable men--</LINE>
      <LINE>Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.</LINE>
      <LINE>He was my friend, faithful and just to me:</LINE>
      <LINE>But Brutus says he was ambitious;</LINE>
      <LINE>And Brutus is an honourable man.</LINE>
      <LINE>He hath brought many captives home to Rome</LINE>
      <LINE>Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:</LINE>
      <LINE>Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?</LINE>
      <LINE>When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:</LINE>
      <LINE>Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:</LINE>
      <LINE>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</LINE>
      <LINE>And Brutus is an honourable man.</LINE>
      <LINE>You all did see that on the Lupercal</LINE>
      <LINE>I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</LINE>
      <LINE>Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?</LINE>
      <LINE>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</LINE>
      <LINE>And, sure, he is an honourable man.</LINE>
      <LINE>I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,</LINE>
      <LINE>But here I am to speak what I do know.</LINE>
      <LINE>You all did love him once, not without cause:</LINE>
      <LINE>What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?</LINE>
      <LINE>O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,</LINE>
      <LINE>And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;</LINE>
      <LINE>My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,</LINE>
      <LINE>And I must pause till it come back to me.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>If thou consider rightly of the matter,</LINE>
      <LINE>Caesar has had great wrong.</LINE>

    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Has he, masters?</LINE>
      <LINE>I fear there will a worse come in his place.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>Fourth Citizen</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;</LINE>
      <LINE>Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>If it be found so, some will dear abide it.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>

    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>But yesterday the word of Caesar might</LINE>
      <LINE>Have stood against the world; now lies he there.</LINE>
      <LINE>And none so poor to do him reverence.</LINE>
      <LINE>O masters, if I were disposed to stir</LINE>
      <LINE>Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,</LINE>
      <LINE>I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,</LINE>
      <LINE>Who, you all know, are honourable men:</LINE>
      <LINE>I will not do them wrong; I rather choose</LINE>
      <LINE>To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,</LINE>
      <LINE>Than I will wrong such honourable men.</LINE>
      <LINE>But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;</LINE>
      <LINE>I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:</LINE>
      <LINE>Let but the commons hear this testament--</LINE>
      <LINE>Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--</LINE>
      <LINE>And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds</LINE>
      <LINE>And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,</LINE>
      <LINE>Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,</LINE>
      <LINE>And, dying, mention it within their wills,</LINE>
      <LINE>Bequeathing it as a rich legacy</LINE>
      <LINE>Unto their issue.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>Fourth Citizen</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.</LINE>

      <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;</LINE>
      <LINE>It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.</LINE>
      <LINE>You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;</LINE>
      <LINE>And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,</LINE>
      <LINE>It will inflame you, it will make you mad:</LINE>
      <LINE>'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;</LINE>
      <LINE>For, if you should, O, what would come of it!</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>

      <LINE>If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.</LINE>
      <LINE>You all do know this mantle: I remember</LINE>
      <LINE>The first time ever Caesar put it on;</LINE>
      <LINE>'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,</LINE>
      <LINE>That day he overcame the Nervii:</LINE>
      <LINE>Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:</LINE>
      <LINE>See what a rent the envious Casca made:</LINE>
      <LINE>Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;</LINE>
      <LINE>And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,</LINE>
      <LINE>Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,</LINE>
      <LINE>As rushing out of doors, to be resolved</LINE>
      <LINE>If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;</LINE>
      <LINE>For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:</LINE>
      <LINE>Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!</LINE>
      <LINE>This was the most unkindest cut of all;</LINE>
      <LINE>For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,</LINE>
      <LINE>Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,</LINE>
      <LINE>Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;</LINE>
      <LINE>And, in his mantle muffling up his face,</LINE>
      <LINE>Even at the base of Pompey's statua,</LINE>
      <LINE>Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.</LINE>
      <LINE>O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!</LINE>
      <LINE>Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,</LINE>
      <LINE>Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.</LINE>
      <LINE>O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel</LINE>
      <LINE>The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.</LINE>

      <LINE>Your reason?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>This it is:</LINE>
      <LINE>'Tis better that the enemy seek us:</LINE>
      <LINE>So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,</LINE>

      <LINE>The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground</LINE>

      <LINE>For they have grudged us contribution:</LINE>

      <LINE>By them shall make a fuller number up,</LINE>
      <LINE>Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;</LINE>
      <LINE>From which advantage shall we cut him off,</LINE>

      <LINE>Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:</LINE>
      <LINE>The enemy increaseth every day;</LINE>
      <LINE>We, at the height, are ready to decline.</LINE>
      <LINE>There is a tide in the affairs of men,</LINE>
      <LINE>Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;</LINE>
      <LINE>Omitted, all the voyage of their life</LINE>
      <LINE>Is bound in shallows and in miseries.</LINE>
      <LINE>On such a full sea are we now afloat;</LINE>

      <LINE>Messala,</LINE>
      <LINE>This is my birth-day; as this very day</LINE>
      <LINE>Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:</LINE>
      <LINE>Be thou my witness that against my will,</LINE>
      <LINE>As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set</LINE>
      <LINE>Upon one battle all our liberties.</LINE>
      <LINE>You know that I held Epicurus strong</LINE>
      <LINE>And his opinion: now I change my mind,</LINE>
      <LINE>And partly credit things that do presage.</LINE>
      <LINE>Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign</LINE>
      <LINE>Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,</LINE>
      <LINE>Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;</LINE>
      <LINE>Who to Philippi here consorted us:</LINE>
      <LINE>This morning are they fled away and gone;</LINE>
      <LINE>And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,</LINE>
      <LINE>Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,</LINE>
      <LINE>As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem</LINE>
      <LINE>A canopy most fatal, under which</LINE>
      <LINE>Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.</LINE>

      <LINE>Even so, Lucilius.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Now, most noble Brutus,</LINE>
      <LINE>The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,</LINE>
      <LINE>Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!</LINE>
      <LINE>But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,</LINE>
      <LINE>Let's reason with the worst that may befall.</LINE>
      <LINE>If we do lose this battle, then is this</LINE>
      <LINE>The very last time we shall speak together:</LINE>
      <LINE>What are you then determined to do?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Even by the rule of that philosophy</LINE>
      <LINE>By which I did blame Cato for the death</LINE>
      <LINE>Which he did give himself, I know not how,</LINE>
      <LINE>But I do find it cowardly and vile,</LINE>
      <LINE>For fear of what might fall, so to prevent</LINE>
      <LINE>The time of life: arming myself with patience</LINE>
      <LINE>To stay the providence of some high powers</LINE>
      <LINE>That govern us below.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Then, if we lose this battle,</LINE>
      <LINE>You are contented to be led in triumph</LINE>
      <LINE>Thorough the streets of Rome?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,</LINE>
      <LINE>That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;</LINE>
      <LINE>He bears too great a mind. But this same day</LINE>
      <LINE>Must end that work the ides of March begun;</LINE>
      <LINE>And whether we shall meet again I know not.</LINE>
      <LINE>Therefore our everlasting farewell take:</LINE>
      <LINE>For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!</LINE>
      <LINE>If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;</LINE>
      <LINE>If not, why then, this parting was well made.</LINE>

      <LINE>Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know</LINE>

      <LINE>Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.</LINE>
      <LINE>Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;</LINE>
      <LINE>Our enemies have beat us to the pit:</LINE>
      <STAGEDIR>Low alarums</STAGEDIR>
      <LINE>It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,</LINE>
      <LINE>Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,</LINE>
      <LINE>Thou know'st that we two went to school together:</LINE>
      <LINE>Even for that our love of old, I prithee,</LINE>
      <LINE>Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.</LINE>

      <LINE>Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:</LINE>
      <LINE>The conquerors can but make a fire of him;</LINE>

    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>This was the noblest Roman of them all:</LINE>
      <LINE>All the conspirators save only he</LINE>
      <LINE>Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;</LINE>
      <LINE>He only, in a general honest thought</LINE>
      <LINE>And common good to all, made one of them.</LINE>
      <LINE>His life was gentle, and the elements</LINE>
      <LINE>So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up</LINE>
      <LINE>And say to all the world 'This was a man!'</LINE>
    </SPEECH>
    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>According to his virtue let us use him,</LINE>
      <LINE>With all respect and rites of burial.</LINE>
      <LINE>Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,</LINE>
      <LINE>Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.</LINE>
      <LINE>So call the field to rest; and let's away,</LINE>
      <LINE>To part the glories of this happy day.</LINE>

    <SPEAKER>FLAVIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:</LINE>
    <LINE>Is this a holiday? what! know you not,</LINE>
    <LINE>Being mechanical, you ought not walk</LINE>
    <LINE>Upon a labouring day without the sign</LINE>
    <LINE>Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>First Commoner</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Why, sir, a carpenter.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?</LINE>
    <LINE>What dost thou with thy best apparel on?</LINE>
    <LINE>You, sir, what trade are you?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,</LINE>
    <LINE>as you would say, a cobbler.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>But what trade art thou? answer me directly.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe</LINE>
    <LINE>conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,</LINE>
    <LINE>if you be out, sir, I can mend you.</LINE>

    <LINE>Why, sir, cobble you.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>

    <SPEAKER>FLAVIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Thou art a cobbler, art thou?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I</LINE>
    <LINE>meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's</LINE>
    <LINE>matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon</LINE>
    <LINE>to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I</LINE>
    <LINE>recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon</LINE>
    <LINE>neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>FLAVIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>But wherefore art not in thy shop today?</LINE>
    <LINE>Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>Second Commoner</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself</LINE>
    <LINE>into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,</LINE>
    <LINE>to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?</LINE>
    <LINE>What tributaries follow him to Rome,</LINE>
    <LINE>To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?</LINE>
    <LINE>You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!</LINE>
    <LINE>O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,</LINE>
    <LINE>Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft</LINE>
    <LINE>Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,</LINE>
    <LINE>To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,</LINE>
    <LINE>Your infants in your arms, and there have sat</LINE>
    <LINE>The livelong day, with patient expectation,</LINE>
    <LINE>To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:</LINE>
    <LINE>And when you saw his chariot but appear,</LINE>
    <LINE>Have you not made an universal shout,</LINE>
    <LINE>That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,</LINE>
    <LINE>To hear the replication of your sounds</LINE>
    <LINE>Made in her concave shores?</LINE>
    <LINE>And do you now put on your best attire?</LINE>
    <LINE>And do you now cull out a holiday?</LINE>
    <LINE>And do you now strew flowers in his way</LINE>
    <LINE>That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!</LINE>
    <LINE>Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,</LINE>
    <LINE>Pray to the gods to intermit the plague</LINE>
    <LINE>That needs must light on this ingratitude.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>FLAVIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,</LINE>
    <LINE>Assemble all the poor men of your sort;</LINE>
    <LINE>Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears</LINE>
    <LINE>Into the channel, till the lowest stream</LINE>
    <LINE>Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.</LINE>
    <STAGEDIR>Exeunt all the Commoners</STAGEDIR>
    <LINE>See whether their basest metal be not moved;</LINE>
    <LINE>They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.</LINE>
    <LINE>Go you down that way towards the Capitol;</LINE>
    <LINE>This way will I disrobe the images,</LINE>
    <LINE>If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>MARULLUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>May we do so?</LINE>
    <LINE>You know it is the feast of Lupercal.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>FLAVIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>It is no matter; let no images</LINE>
    <LINE>Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,</LINE>
    <LINE>And drive away the vulgar from the streets:</LINE>
    <LINE>So do you too, where you perceive them thick.</LINE>
    <LINE>These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing</LINE>
    <LINE>Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,</LINE>
    <LINE>Who else would soar above the view of men</LINE>
    <LINE>And keep us all in servile fearfulness.</LINE>

    <LINE>Will you go see the order of the course?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Not I.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I pray you, do.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I am not gamesome: I do lack some part</LINE>
    <LINE>Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.</LINE>
    <LINE>Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;</LINE>
    <LINE>I'll leave you.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Brutus, I do observe you now of late:</LINE>
    <LINE>I have not from your eyes that gentleness</LINE>
    <LINE>And show of love as I was wont to have:</LINE>
    <LINE>You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand</LINE>
    <LINE>Over your friend that loves you.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Cassius,</LINE>
    <LINE>Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,</LINE>
    <LINE>I turn the trouble of my countenance</LINE>
    <LINE>Merely upon myself. Vexed I am</LINE>
    <LINE>Of late with passions of some difference,</LINE>
    <LINE>Conceptions only proper to myself,</LINE>
    <LINE>Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;</LINE>
    <LINE>But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--</LINE>
    <LINE>Among which number, Cassius, be you one--</LINE>
    <LINE>Nor construe any further my neglect,</LINE>
    <LINE>Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,</LINE>
    <LINE>Forgets the shows of love to other men.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;</LINE>
    <LINE>By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried</LINE>
    <LINE>Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.</LINE>
    <LINE>Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,</LINE>
    <LINE>But by reflection, by some other things.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>'Tis just:</LINE>
    <LINE>And it is very much lamented, Brutus,</LINE>
    <LINE>That you have no such mirrors as will turn</LINE>
    <LINE>Your hidden worthiness into your eye,</LINE>
    <LINE>That you might see your shadow. I have heard,</LINE>
    <LINE>Where many of the best respect in Rome,</LINE>
    <LINE>Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus</LINE>
    <LINE>And groaning underneath this age's yoke,</LINE>
    <LINE>Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,</LINE>
    <LINE>That you would have me seek into myself</LINE>
    <LINE>For that which is not in me?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:</LINE>
    <LINE>And since you know you cannot see yourself</LINE>
    <LINE>So well as by reflection, I, your glass,</LINE>
    <LINE>Will modestly discover to yourself</LINE>
    <LINE>That of yourself which you yet know not of.</LINE>
    <LINE>And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:</LINE>
    <LINE>Were I a common laugher, or did use</LINE>
    <LINE>To stale with ordinary oaths my love</LINE>
    <LINE>To every new protester; if you know</LINE>
    <LINE>That I do fawn on men and hug them hard</LINE>
    <LINE>And after scandal them, or if you know</LINE>
    <LINE>That I profess myself in banqueting</LINE>
    <LINE>To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <STAGEDIR>Flourish, and shout</STAGEDIR>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>What means this shouting? I do fear, the people</LINE>
    <LINE>Choose Caesar for their king.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Ay, do you fear it?</LINE>
    <LINE>Then must I think you would not have it so.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.</LINE>
    <LINE>But wherefore do you hold me here so long?</LINE>
    <LINE>What is it that you would impart to me?</LINE>
    <LINE>If it be aught toward the general good,</LINE>
    <LINE>Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,</LINE>
    <LINE>And I will look on both indifferently,</LINE>
    <LINE>For let the gods so speed me as I love</LINE>
    <LINE>The name of honour more than I fear death.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</LINE>
    <LINE>As well as I do know your outward favour.</LINE>
    <LINE>Well, honour is the subject of my story.</LINE>
    <LINE>I cannot tell what you and other men</LINE>
    <LINE>Think of this life; but, for my single self,</LINE>
    <LINE>I had as lief not be as live to be</LINE>
    <LINE>In awe of such a thing as I myself.</LINE>
    <LINE>I was born free as Caesar; so were you:</LINE>
    <LINE>We both have fed as well, and we can both</LINE>
    <LINE>Endure the winter's cold as well as he:</LINE>
    <LINE>For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</LINE>
    <LINE>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</LINE>
    <LINE>Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now</LINE>
    <LINE>Leap in with me into this angry flood,</LINE>
    <LINE>And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,</LINE>
    <LINE>Accoutred as I was, I plunged in</LINE>
    <LINE>And bade him follow; so indeed he did.</LINE>
    <LINE>The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it</LINE>
    <LINE>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</LINE>
    <LINE>And stemming it with hearts of controversy;</LINE>
    <LINE>But ere we could arrive the point proposed,</LINE>
    <LINE>Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'</LINE>
    <LINE>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</LINE>
    <LINE>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</LINE>
    <LINE>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</LINE>
    <LINE>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</LINE>
    <LINE>Is now become a god, and Cassius is</LINE>
    <LINE>A wretched creature and must bend his body,</LINE>
    <LINE>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</LINE>
    <LINE>He had a fever when he was in Spain,</LINE>
    <LINE>And when the fit was on him, I did mark</LINE>
    <LINE>How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;</LINE>
    <LINE>His coward lips did from their colour fly,</LINE>
    <LINE>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</LINE>
    <LINE>Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:</LINE>
    <LINE>Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans</LINE>
    <LINE>Mark him and write his speeches in their books,</LINE>
    <LINE>Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'</LINE>
    <LINE>As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me</LINE>
    <LINE>A man of such a feeble temper should</LINE>
    <LINE>So get the start of the majestic world</LINE>
    <LINE>And bear the palm alone.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <STAGEDIR>Shout. Flourish</STAGEDIR>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Another general shout!</LINE>
    <LINE>I do believe that these applauses are</LINE>
    <LINE>For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</LINE>
    <LINE>Like a Colossus, and we petty men</LINE>
    <LINE>Walk under his huge legs and peep about</LINE>
    <LINE>To find ourselves dishonourable graves.</LINE>
    <LINE>Men at some time are masters of their fates:</LINE>
    <LINE>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</LINE>
    <LINE>But in ourselves, that we are underlings.</LINE>
    <LINE>Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?</LINE>
    <LINE>Why should that name be sounded more than yours?</LINE>
    <LINE>Write them together, yours is as fair a name;</LINE>
    <LINE>Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;</LINE>
    <LINE>Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,</LINE>
    <LINE>Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.</LINE>
    <LINE>Now, in the names of all the gods at once,</LINE>
    <LINE>Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,</LINE>
    <LINE>That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!</LINE>
    <LINE>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!</LINE>
    <LINE>When went there by an age, since the great flood,</LINE>
    <LINE>But it was famed with more than with one man?</LINE>
    <LINE>When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,</LINE>
    <LINE>That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?</LINE>
    <LINE>Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,</LINE>
    <LINE>When there is in it but one only man.</LINE>
    <LINE>O, you and I have heard our fathers say,</LINE>
    <LINE>There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd</LINE>
    <LINE>The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome</LINE>
    <LINE>As easily as a king.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;</LINE>
    <LINE>What you would work me to, I have some aim:</LINE>
    <LINE>How I have thought of this and of these times,</LINE>
    <LINE>I shall recount hereafter; for this present,</LINE>
    <LINE>I would not, so with love I might entreat you,</LINE>
    <LINE>Be any further moved. What you have said</LINE>
    <LINE>I will consider; what you have to say</LINE>
    <LINE>I will with patience hear, and find a time</LINE>
    <LINE>Both meet to hear and answer such high things.</LINE>
    <LINE>Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:</LINE>
    <LINE>Brutus had rather be a villager</LINE>
    <LINE>Than to repute himself a son of Rome</LINE>
    <LINE>Under these hard conditions as this time</LINE>
    <LINE>Is like to lay upon us.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I am glad that my weak words</LINE>
    <LINE>Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>The games are done and Caesar is returning.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;</LINE>
    <LINE>And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you</LINE>
    <LINE>What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <STAGEDIR>Re-enter CAESAR and his Train</STAGEDIR>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,</LINE>
    <LINE>The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,</LINE>
    <LINE>And all the rest look like a chidden train:</LINE>
    <LINE>Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero</LINE>
    <LINE>Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes</LINE>
    <LINE>As we have seen him in the Capitol,</LINE>
    <LINE>Being cross'd in conference by some senators.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Casca will tell us what the matter is.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CAESAR</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Antonius!</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Caesar?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CAESAR</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Let me have men about me that are fat;</LINE>
    <LINE>Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:</LINE>
    <LINE>Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;</LINE>
    <LINE>He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;</LINE>
    <LINE>He is a noble Roman and well given.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CAESAR</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:</LINE>
    <LINE>Yet if my name were liable to fear,</LINE>
    <LINE>I do not know the man I should avoid</LINE>
    <LINE>So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;</LINE>
    <LINE>He is a great observer and he looks</LINE>
    <LINE>Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,</LINE>
    <LINE>As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;</LINE>
    <LINE>Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort</LINE>
    <LINE>As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit</LINE>
    <LINE>That could be moved to smile at any thing.</LINE>
    <LINE>Such men as he be never at heart's ease</LINE>
    <LINE>Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,</LINE>
    <LINE>And therefore are they very dangerous.</LINE>
    <LINE>I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd</LINE>
    <LINE>Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.</LINE>
    <LINE>Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,</LINE>
    <LINE>And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <STAGEDIR>Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA</STAGEDIR>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,</LINE>
    <LINE>That Caesar looks so sad.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Why, you were with him, were you not?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Why, there was a crown offered him: and being</LINE>
    <LINE>offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,</LINE>
    <LINE>thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>What was the second noise for?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Why, for that too.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Why, for that too.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Was the crown offered him thrice?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every</LINE>
    <LINE>time gentler than other, and at every putting-by</LINE>
    <LINE>mine honest neighbours shouted.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Who offered him the crown?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Why, Antony.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:</LINE>
    <LINE>it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark</LINE>
    <LINE>Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown</LINE>
    <LINE>neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told</LINE>
    <LINE>you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my</LINE>
    <LINE>thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he</LINE>
    <LINE>offered it to him again; then he put it by again:</LINE>
    <LINE>but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his</LINE>
    <LINE>fingers off it. And then he offered it the third</LINE>
    <LINE>time; he put it the third time by: and still as he</LINE>
    <LINE>refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their</LINE>
    <LINE>chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps</LINE>
    <LINE>and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because</LINE>
    <LINE>Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked</LINE>
    <LINE>Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and</LINE>
    <LINE>for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of</LINE>
    <LINE>opening my lips and receiving the bad air.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at</LINE>
    <LINE>mouth, and was speechless.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,</LINE>
    <LINE>And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,</LINE>
    <LINE>Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not</LINE>
    <LINE>clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and</LINE>
    <LINE>displeased them, as they use to do the players in</LINE>
    <LINE>the theatre, I am no true man.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>What said he when he came unto himself?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the</LINE>
    <LINE>common herd was glad he refused the crown, he</LINE>
    <LINE>plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his</LINE>
    <LINE>throat to cut. An I had been a man of any</LINE>
    <LINE>occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,</LINE>
    <LINE>I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so</LINE>
    <LINE>he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,</LINE>
    <LINE>If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired</LINE>
    <LINE>their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three</LINE>
    <LINE>or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good</LINE>
    <LINE>soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but</LINE>
    <LINE>there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had</LINE>
    <LINE>stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>And after that, he came, thus sad, away?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Ay.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Did Cicero say any thing?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Ay, he spoke Greek.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>To what effect?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the</LINE>
    <LINE>face again: but those that understood him smiled at</LINE>
    <LINE>one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own</LINE>
    <LINE>part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more</LINE>
    <LINE>news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs</LINE>
    <LINE>off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you</LINE>
    <LINE>well. There was more foolery yet, if I could</LINE>
    <LINE>remember it.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>No, I am promised forth.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Will you dine with me to-morrow?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner</LINE>
    <LINE>worth the eating.</LINE>

    <LINE>Good: I will expect you.</LINE>

    <LINE>And so it is. For this time I will leave you:</LINE>
    <LINE>To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,</LINE>
    <LINE>I will come home to you; or, if you will,</LINE>
    <LINE>Come home to me, and I will wait for you.</LINE>

    <LINE>I will do so: till then, think of the world.</LINE>

    <LINE>Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,</LINE>
    <LINE>Thy honourable metal may be wrought</LINE>
    <LINE>From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet</LINE>
    <LINE>That noble minds keep ever with their likes;</LINE>
    <LINE>For who so firm that cannot be seduced?</LINE>
    <LINE>Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:</LINE>
    <LINE>If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,</LINE>
    <LINE>He should not humour me. I will this night,</LINE>
    <LINE>In several hands, in at his windows throw,</LINE>
    <LINE>As if they came from several citizens,</LINE>
    <LINE>Writings all tending to the great opinion</LINE>
    <LINE>That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely</LINE>
    <LINE>Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:</LINE>
    <LINE>And after this let Caesar seat him sure;</LINE>

  <TITLE>SCENE III.  The same. A street.</TITLE>
  <STAGEDIR>Thunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides,
CASCA, with his sword drawn, and CICERO</STAGEDIR>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CICERO</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?</LINE>
    <LINE>Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth</LINE>
    <LINE>Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,</LINE>
    <LINE>I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds</LINE>
    <LINE>Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen</LINE>
    <LINE>The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,</LINE>
    <LINE>To be exalted with the threatening clouds:</LINE>
    <LINE>But never till to-night, never till now,</LINE>
    <LINE>Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.</LINE>
    <LINE>Either there is a civil strife in heaven,</LINE>
    <LINE>Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,</LINE>
    <LINE>Incenses them to send destruction.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CICERO</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>A common slave--you know him well by sight--</LINE>
    <LINE>Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn</LINE>
    <LINE>Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,</LINE>
    <LINE>Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.</LINE>
    <LINE>Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--</LINE>
    <LINE>Against the Capitol I met a lion,</LINE>
    <LINE>Who glared upon me, and went surly by,</LINE>
    <LINE>Without annoying me: and there were drawn</LINE>
    <LINE>Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,</LINE>
    <LINE>Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw</LINE>
    <LINE>Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.</LINE>
    <LINE>And yesterday the bird of night did sit</LINE>
    <LINE>Even at noon-day upon the market-place,</LINE>
    <LINE>Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies</LINE>
    <LINE>Do so conjointly meet, let not men say</LINE>
    <LINE>'These are their reasons; they are natural;'</LINE>
    <LINE>For, I believe, they are portentous things</LINE>
    <LINE>Unto the climate that they point upon.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CICERO</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:</LINE>
    <LINE>But men may construe things after their fashion,</LINE>
    <LINE>Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.</LINE>
    <LINE>Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>He doth; for he did bid Antonius</LINE>
    <LINE>Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CICERO</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky</LINE>
    <LINE>Is not to walk in.</LINE>

    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Farewell, Cicero.</LINE>

  <STAGEDIR>Exit CICERO</STAGEDIR>
  <STAGEDIR>Enter CASSIUS</STAGEDIR>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Who's there?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>A Roman.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Casca, by your voice.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>A very pleasing night to honest men.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Who ever knew the heavens menace so?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Those that have known the earth so full of faults.</LINE>
    <LINE>For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,</LINE>
    <LINE>Submitting me unto the perilous night,</LINE>
    <LINE>And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,</LINE>
    <LINE>Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;</LINE>
    <LINE>And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open</LINE>
    <LINE>The breast of heaven, I did present myself</LINE>
    <LINE>Even in the aim and very flash of it.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?</LINE>
    <LINE>It is the part of men to fear and tremble,</LINE>
    <LINE>When the most mighty gods by tokens send</LINE>
    <LINE>Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life</LINE>
    <LINE>That should be in a Roman you do want,</LINE>
    <LINE>Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze</LINE>
    <LINE>And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,</LINE>
    <LINE>To see the strange impatience of the heavens:</LINE>
    <LINE>But if you would consider the true cause</LINE>
    <LINE>Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,</LINE>
    <LINE>Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,</LINE>
    <LINE>Why old men fool and children calculate,</LINE>
    <LINE>Why all these things change from their ordinance</LINE>
    <LINE>Their natures and preformed faculties</LINE>
    <LINE>To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find</LINE>
    <LINE>That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,</LINE>
    <LINE>To make them instruments of fear and warning</LINE>
    <LINE>Unto some monstrous state.</LINE>
    <LINE>Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man</LINE>
    <LINE>Most like this dreadful night,</LINE>
    <LINE>That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars</LINE>
    <LINE>As doth the lion in the Capitol,</LINE>
    <LINE>A man no mightier than thyself or me</LINE>
    <LINE>In personal action, yet prodigious grown</LINE>
    <LINE>And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Let it be who it is: for Romans now</LINE>
    <LINE>Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;</LINE>
    <LINE>But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,</LINE>
    <LINE>And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;</LINE>
    <LINE>Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow</LINE>
    <LINE>Mean to establish Caesar as a king;</LINE>
    <LINE>And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,</LINE>
    <LINE>In every place, save here in Italy.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I know where I will wear this dagger then;</LINE>
    <LINE>Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:</LINE>
    <LINE>Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;</LINE>
    <LINE>Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:</LINE>
    <LINE>Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,</LINE>
    <LINE>Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,</LINE>
    <LINE>Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;</LINE>
    <LINE>But life, being weary of these worldly bars,</LINE>
    <LINE>Never lacks power to dismiss itself.</LINE>
    <LINE>If I know this, know all the world besides,</LINE>
    <LINE>That part of tyranny that I do bear</LINE>
    <LINE>I can shake off at pleasure.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <STAGEDIR>Thunder still</STAGEDIR>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>So can I:</LINE>
    <LINE>So every bondman in his own hand bears</LINE>
    <LINE>The power to cancel his captivity.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?</LINE>
    <LINE>Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,</LINE>
    <LINE>But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:</LINE>
    <LINE>He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.</LINE>
    <LINE>Those that with haste will make a mighty fire</LINE>
    <LINE>Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,</LINE>
    <LINE>What rubbish and what offal, when it serves</LINE>
    <LINE>For the base matter to illuminate</LINE>
    <LINE>So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,</LINE>
    <LINE>Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this</LINE>
    <LINE>Before a willing bondman; then I know</LINE>
    <LINE>My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,</LINE>
    <LINE>And dangers are to me indifferent.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>You speak to Casca, and to such a man</LINE>
    <LINE>That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:</LINE>
    <LINE>Be factious for redress of all these griefs,</LINE>
    <LINE>And I will set this foot of mine as far</LINE>
    <LINE>As who goes farthest.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>There's a bargain made.</LINE>
    <LINE>Now know you, Casca, I have moved already</LINE>
    <LINE>Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans</LINE>
    <LINE>To undergo with me an enterprise</LINE>
    <LINE>Of honourable-dangerous consequence;</LINE>
    <LINE>And I do know, by this, they stay for me</LINE>
    <LINE>In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,</LINE>
    <LINE>There is no stir or walking in the streets;</LINE>
    <LINE>And the complexion of the element</LINE>
    <LINE>In favour's like the work we have in hand,</LINE>
    <LINE>Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>

    <LINE>'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;</LINE>
    <LINE>He is a friend.</LINE>

    <LINE>Cinna, where haste you so?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>

    <LINE>No, it is Casca; one incorporate</LINE>
    <LINE>To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CINNA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!</LINE>
    <LINE>There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Am I not stay'd for? tell me.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CINNA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Yes, you are.</LINE>
    <LINE>O Cassius, if you could</LINE>
    <LINE>But win the noble Brutus to our party--</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,</LINE>
    <LINE>And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,</LINE>
    <LINE>Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this</LINE>
    <LINE>In at his window; set this up with wax</LINE>
    <LINE>Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,</LINE>
    <LINE>Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.</LINE>
    <LINE>Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CINNA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone</LINE>
    <LINE>To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,</LINE>
    <LINE>And so bestow these papers as you bade me.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.</LINE>
    <STAGEDIR>Exit CINNA</STAGEDIR>
    <LINE>Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day</LINE>
    <LINE>See Brutus at his house: three parts of him</LINE>
    <LINE>Is ours already, and the man entire</LINE>
    <LINE>Upon the next encounter yields him ours.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:</LINE>
    <LINE>And that which would appear offence in us,</LINE>
    <LINE>His countenance, like richest alchemy,</LINE>
    <LINE>Will change to virtue and to worthiness.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Him and his worth and our great need of him</LINE>
    <LINE>You have right well conceited. Let us go,</LINE>

    <LINE>It must be by his death: and for my part,</LINE>
    <LINE>I know no personal cause to spurn at him,</LINE>
    <LINE>But for the general. He would be crown'd:</LINE>
    <LINE>How that might change his nature, there's the question.</LINE>
    <LINE>It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;</LINE>
    <LINE>And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--</LINE>
    <LINE>And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,</LINE>
    <LINE>That at his will he may do danger with.</LINE>
    <LINE>The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins</LINE>
    <LINE>Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,</LINE>
    <LINE>I have not known when his affections sway'd</LINE>
    <LINE>More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,</LINE>
    <LINE>That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,</LINE>
    <LINE>Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;</LINE>
    <LINE>But when he once attains the upmost round.</LINE>
    <LINE>He then unto the ladder turns his back,</LINE>
    <LINE>Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees</LINE>
    <LINE>By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.</LINE>
    <LINE>Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel</LINE>
    <LINE>Will bear no colour for the thing he is,</LINE>
    <LINE>Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,</LINE>
    <LINE>Would run to these and these extremities:</LINE>
    <LINE>And therefore think him as a serpent's egg</LINE>
    <LINE>Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,</LINE>

    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>You shall confess that you are both deceived.</LINE>
    <LINE>Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,</LINE>
    <LINE>Which is a great way growing on the south,</LINE>
    <LINE>Weighing the youthful season of the year.</LINE>
    <LINE>Some two months hence up higher toward the north</LINE>
    <LINE>He first presents his fire; and the high east</LINE>
    <LINE>Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.</LINE>

    <LINE>And let us swear our resolution.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>No, not an oath: if not the face of men,</LINE>
    <LINE>The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--</LINE>
    <LINE>If these be motives weak, break off betimes,</LINE>
    <LINE>And every man hence to his idle bed;</LINE>
    <LINE>So let high-sighted tyranny range on,</LINE>
    <LINE>Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,</LINE>
    <LINE>As I am sure they do, bear fire enough</LINE>
    <LINE>To kindle cowards and to steel with valour</LINE>
    <LINE>The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,</LINE>
    <LINE>What need we any spur but our own cause,</LINE>
    <LINE>To prick us to redress? what other bond</LINE>
    <LINE>Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,</LINE>
    <LINE>And will not palter? and what other oath</LINE>
    <LINE>Than honesty to honesty engaged,</LINE>
    <LINE>That this shall be, or we will fall for it?</LINE>
    <LINE>Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,</LINE>
    <LINE>Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls</LINE>
    <LINE>That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear</LINE>
    <LINE>Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain</LINE>
    <LINE>The even virtue of our enterprise,</LINE>
    <LINE>Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,</LINE>
    <LINE>To think that or our cause or our performance</LINE>
    <LINE>Did need an oath; when every drop of blood</LINE>
    <LINE>That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,</LINE>
    <LINE>Is guilty of a several bastardy,</LINE>
    <LINE>If he do break the smallest particle</LINE>
    <LINE>Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?</LINE>
    <LINE>I think he will stand very strong with us.</LINE>

  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Let us not leave him out.</LINE>

    <LINE>No, by no means.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>METELLUS CIMBER</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>O, let us have him, for his silver hairs</LINE>
    <LINE>Will purchase us a good opinion</LINE>
    <LINE>And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:</LINE>
    <LINE>It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;</LINE>
    <LINE>Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,</LINE>
    <LINE>But all be buried in his gravity.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>O, name him not: let us not break with him;</LINE>
    <LINE>For he will never follow any thing</LINE>
    <LINE>That other men begin.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Then leave him out.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Indeed he is not fit.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>DECIUS BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,</LINE>
    <LINE>Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,</LINE>
    <LINE>Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him</LINE>
    <LINE>A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,</LINE>
    <LINE>If he improve them, may well stretch so far</LINE>
    <LINE>As to annoy us all: which to prevent,</LINE>
    <LINE>Let Antony and Caesar fall together.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,</LINE>
    <LINE>To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,</LINE>
    <LINE>Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;</LINE>
    <LINE>For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:</LINE>
    <LINE>Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.</LINE>
    <LINE>We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;</LINE>
    <LINE>And in the spirit of men there is no blood:</LINE>
    <LINE>O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,</LINE>
    <LINE>And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,</LINE>
    <LINE>Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,</LINE>
    <LINE>Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;</LINE>
    <LINE>Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,</LINE>
    <LINE>Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:</LINE>
    <LINE>And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,</LINE>
    <LINE>Stir up their servants to an act of rage,</LINE>
    <LINE>And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make</LINE>
    <LINE>Our purpose necessary and not envious:</LINE>
    <LINE>Which so appearing to the common eyes,</LINE>
    <LINE>We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.</LINE>
    <LINE>And for Mark Antony, think not of him;</LINE>
    <LINE>For he can do no more than Caesar's arm</LINE>
    <LINE>When Caesar's head is off.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Yet I fear him;</LINE>
    <LINE>For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:</LINE>
    <LINE>If he love Caesar, all that he can do</LINE>
    <LINE>Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:</LINE>
    <LINE>And that were much he should; for he is given</LINE>
    <LINE>To sports, to wildness and much company.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>TREBONIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>There is no fear in him; let him not die;</LINE>
    <LINE>For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.</LINE>

    <LINE>Peace! count the clock.</LINE>

    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>The clock hath stricken three.</LINE>

  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>TREBONIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>'Tis time to part.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>But it is doubtful yet,</LINE>
    <LINE>Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;</LINE>
    <LINE>For he is superstitious grown of late,</LINE>
    <LINE>Quite from the main opinion he held once</LINE>
    <LINE>Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:</LINE>
    <LINE>It may be, these apparent prodigies,</LINE>
    <LINE>The unaccustom'd terror of this night,</LINE>
    <LINE>And the persuasion of his augurers,</LINE>
    <LINE>May hold him from the Capitol to-day.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>DECIUS BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Never fear that: if he be so resolved,</LINE>
    <LINE>I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear</LINE>
    <LINE>That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,</LINE>
    <LINE>And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,</LINE>
    <LINE>Lions with toils and men with flatterers;</LINE>
    <LINE>But when I tell him he hates flatterers,</LINE>
    <LINE>He says he does, being then most flattered.</LINE>
    <LINE>Let me work;</LINE>
    <LINE>For I can give his humour the true bent,</LINE>
    <LINE>And I will bring him to the Capitol.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>

  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Now, good Metellus, go along by him:</LINE>

    <LINE>Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>PORTIA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,</LINE>
    <LINE>Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,</LINE>
    <LINE>You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,</LINE>
    <LINE>Musing and sighing, with your arms across,</LINE>
    <LINE>And when I ask'd you what the matter was,</LINE>
    <LINE>You stared upon me with ungentle looks;</LINE>
    <LINE>I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,</LINE>
    <LINE>And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;</LINE>
    <LINE>Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,</LINE>
    <LINE>But, with an angry wafture of your hand,</LINE>
    <LINE>Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;</LINE>
    <LINE>Fearing to strengthen that impatience</LINE>
    <LINE>Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal</LINE>
    <LINE>Hoping it was but an effect of humour,</LINE>
    <LINE>Which sometime hath his hour with every man.</LINE>
    <LINE>It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,</LINE>
    <LINE>And could it work so much upon your shape</LINE>
    <LINE>As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,</LINE>
    <LINE>I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,</LINE>
    <LINE>Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.</LINE>

  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>PORTIA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Is Brutus sick? and is it physical</LINE>
    <LINE>To walk unbraced and suck up the humours</LINE>
    <LINE>Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,</LINE>
    <LINE>And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,</LINE>
    <LINE>To dare the vile contagion of the night</LINE>
    <LINE>And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air</LINE>
    <LINE>To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;</LINE>
    <LINE>You have some sick offence within your mind,</LINE>
    <LINE>Which, by the right and virtue of my place,</LINE>
    <LINE>I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,</LINE>
    <LINE>I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,</LINE>
    <LINE>By all your vows of love and that great vow</LINE>
    <LINE>Which did incorporate and make us one,</LINE>
    <LINE>That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,</LINE>
    <LINE>Why you are heavy, and what men to-night</LINE>
    <LINE>Have had to resort to you: for here have been</LINE>
    <LINE>Some six or seven, who did hide their faces</LINE>
    <LINE>Even from darkness.</LINE>

    <LINE>Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,</LINE>
    <LINE>Is it excepted I should know no secrets</LINE>
    <LINE>That appertain to you? Am I yourself</LINE>
    <LINE>But, as it were, in sort or limitation,</LINE>
    <LINE>To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,</LINE>
    <LINE>And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs</LINE>
    <LINE>Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,</LINE>

    <LINE>I grant I am a woman; but withal</LINE>
    <LINE>A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.</LINE>
    <LINE>Think you I am no stronger than my sex,</LINE>
    <LINE>Being so father'd and so husbanded?</LINE>
    <LINE>Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:</LINE>
    <LINE>I have made strong proof of my constancy,</LINE>
    <LINE>Giving myself a voluntary wound</LINE>
    <LINE>Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.</LINE>
    <LINE>And not my husband's secrets?</LINE>

    <LINE>She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,</LINE>
    <LINE>Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,</LINE>
    <LINE>Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans</LINE>
    <LINE>Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:</LINE>
    <LINE>And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,</LINE>
    <LINE>And evils imminent; and on her knee</LINE>
    <LINE>Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>DECIUS BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>This dream is all amiss interpreted;</LINE>
    <LINE>It was a vision fair and fortunate:</LINE>
    <LINE>Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,</LINE>
    <LINE>In which so many smiling Romans bathed,</LINE>
    <LINE>Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck</LINE>
    <LINE>Reviving blood, and that great men shall press</LINE>
    <LINE>For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.</LINE>
    <LINE>This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.</LINE>

    <LINE>To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.</LINE>
    <LINE>If you shall send them word you will not come,</LINE>
    <LINE>Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock</LINE>
    <LINE>Apt to be render'd, for some one to say</LINE>
    <LINE>'Break up the senate till another time,</LINE>
    <LINE>When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'</LINE>
    <LINE>If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper</LINE>
    <LINE>'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?</LINE>

    <LINE>Grant that, and then is death a benefit:</LINE>
    <LINE>So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged</LINE>

    <LINE>Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:</LINE>

    <LINE>Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>Servant</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:</LINE>
    <LINE>Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;</LINE>
    <LINE>And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:</LINE>
    <LINE>Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;</LINE>
    <LINE>Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:</LINE>
    <LINE>Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;</LINE>
    <LINE>Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him and loved him.</LINE>
    <LINE>If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony</LINE>
    <LINE>May safely come to him, and be resolved</LINE>
    <LINE>How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,</LINE>
    <LINE>Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead</LINE>
    <LINE>So well as Brutus living; but will follow</LINE>
    <LINE>The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus</LINE>
    <LINE>Thorough the hazards of this untrod state</LINE>
    <LINE>With all true faith. So says my master Antony.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;</LINE>
    <LINE>I never thought him worse.</LINE>
    <LINE>Tell him, so please him come unto this place,</LINE>
    <LINE>He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour,</LINE>
    <LINE>Depart untouch'd.</LINE>

    <LINE>Welcome, Mark Antony.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?</LINE>
    <LINE>Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,</LINE>
    <LINE>Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.</LINE>
    <LINE>I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,</LINE>
    <LINE>Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:</LINE>
    <LINE>If I myself, there is no hour so fit</LINE>
    <LINE>As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument</LINE>
    <LINE>Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich</LINE>
    <LINE>With the most noble blood of all this world.</LINE>
    <LINE>I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,</LINE>
    <LINE>Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,</LINE>
    <LINE>Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,</LINE>
    <LINE>I shall not find myself so apt to die:</LINE>
    <LINE>No place will please me so, no mean of death,</LINE>
    <LINE>As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,</LINE>
    <LINE>The choice and master spirits of this age.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>O Antony, beg not your death of us.</LINE>
    <LINE>Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,</LINE>
    <LINE>As, by our hands and this our present act,</LINE>
    <LINE>You see we do, yet see you but our hands</LINE>
    <LINE>And this the bleeding business they have done:</LINE>
    <LINE>Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;</LINE>
    <LINE>And pity to the general wrong of Rome--</LINE>
    <LINE>As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--</LINE>
    <LINE>Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,</LINE>
    <LINE>To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:</LINE>
    <LINE>Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts</LINE>
    <LINE>Of brothers' temper, do receive you in</LINE>
    <LINE>With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Your voice shall be as strong as any man's</LINE>
    <LINE>In the disposing of new dignities.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Only be patient till we have appeased</LINE>
    <LINE>The multitude, beside themselves with fear,</LINE>
    <LINE>And then we will deliver you the cause,</LINE>
    <LINE>Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,</LINE>
    <LINE>Have thus proceeded.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I doubt not of your wisdom.</LINE>
    <LINE>Let each man render me his bloody hand:</LINE>
    <LINE>First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;</LINE>
    <LINE>Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;</LINE>
    <LINE>Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;</LINE>
    <LINE>Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;</LINE>
    <LINE>Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.</LINE>
    <LINE>Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?</LINE>
    <LINE>My credit now stands on such slippery ground,</LINE>
    <LINE>That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,</LINE>
    <LINE>Either a coward or a flatterer.</LINE>
    <LINE>That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:</LINE>
    <LINE>If then thy spirit look upon us now,</LINE>
    <LINE>Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,</LINE>
    <LINE>To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,</LINE>
    <LINE>Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,</LINE>
    <LINE>Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?</LINE>
    <LINE>Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,</LINE>
    <LINE>Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,</LINE>
    <LINE>It would become me better than to close</LINE>
    <LINE>In terms of friendship with thine enemies.</LINE>
    <LINE>Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;</LINE>
    <LINE>Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,</LINE>
    <LINE>Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.</LINE>
    <LINE>O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;</LINE>
    <LINE>And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.</LINE>
    <LINE>How like a deer, strucken by many princes,</LINE>
    <LINE>Dost thou here lie!</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Mark Antony,--</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Pardon me, Caius Cassius:</LINE>
    <LINE>The enemies of Caesar shall say this;</LINE>
    <LINE>Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I blame you not for praising Caesar so;</LINE>
    <LINE>But what compact mean you to have with us?</LINE>
    <LINE>Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;</LINE>
    <LINE>Or shall we on, and not depend on you?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,</LINE>
    <LINE>Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar.</LINE>
    <LINE>Friends am I with you all and love you all,</LINE>
    <LINE>Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons</LINE>
    <LINE>Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Or else were this a savage spectacle:</LINE>
    <LINE>Our reasons are so full of good regard</LINE>
    <LINE>That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,</LINE>
    <LINE>You should be satisfied.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>That's all I seek:</LINE>
    <LINE>And am moreover suitor that I may</LINE>
    <LINE>Produce his body to the market-place;</LINE>
    <LINE>And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,</LINE>
    <LINE>Speak in the order of his funeral.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>You shall, Mark Antony.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>

    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Brutus, a word with you.</LINE>
    <STAGEDIR>Aside to BRUTUS</STAGEDIR>
    <LINE>You know not what you do: do not consent</LINE>
    <LINE>That Antony speak in his funeral:</LINE>
    <LINE>Know you how much the people may be moved</LINE>
    <LINE>By that which he will utter?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>By your pardon;</LINE>
    <LINE>I will myself into the pulpit first,</LINE>
    <LINE>And show the reason of our Caesar's death:</LINE>
    <LINE>What Antony shall speak, I will protest</LINE>
    <LINE>He speaks by leave and by permission,</LINE>
    <LINE>And that we are contented Caesar shall</LINE>
    <LINE>Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.</LINE>
    <LINE>It shall advantage more than do us wrong.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I know not what may fall; I like it not.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.</LINE>
    <LINE>You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,</LINE>
    <LINE>But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,</LINE>
    <LINE>And say you do't by our permission;</LINE>
    <LINE>Else shall you not have any hand at all</LINE>
    <LINE>About his funeral: and you shall speak</LINE>
    <LINE>In the same pulpit whereto I am going,</LINE>
    <LINE>After my speech is ended.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Be it so.</LINE>
    <LINE>I do desire no more.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>

    <LINE>Prepare the body then, and follow us.</LINE>

  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,</LINE>
    <LINE>That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!</LINE>
    <LINE>Thou art the ruins of the noblest man</LINE>
    <LINE>That ever lived in the tide of times.</LINE>
    <LINE>Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!</LINE>
    <LINE>Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--</LINE>
    <LINE>Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,</LINE>
    <LINE>To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--</LINE>
    <LINE>A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;</LINE>
    <LINE>Domestic fury and fierce civil strife</LINE>
    <LINE>Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;</LINE>
    <LINE>Blood and destruction shall be so in use</LINE>
    <LINE>And dreadful objects so familiar</LINE>
    <LINE>That mothers shall but smile when they behold</LINE>
    <LINE>Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;</LINE>
    <LINE>All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:</LINE>
    <LINE>And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,</LINE>
    <LINE>With Ate by his side come hot from hell,</LINE>
    <LINE>Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice</LINE>
    <LINE>Cry  'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;</LINE>
    <LINE>That this foul deed shall smell above the earth</LINE>
    <LINE>With carrion men, groaning for burial.</LINE>

    <LINE>Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;</LINE>
    <LINE>Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse</LINE>

    <LINE>The cruel issue of these bloody men;</LINE>
    <LINE>According to the which, thou shalt discourse</LINE>

  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Be patient till the last.</LINE>
    <LINE>Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my</LINE>
    <LINE>cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me</LINE>
    <LINE>for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that</LINE>
    <LINE>you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and</LINE>
    <LINE>awake your senses, that you may the better judge.</LINE>
    <LINE>If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of</LINE>
    <LINE>Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar</LINE>
    <LINE>was no less than his. If then that friend demand</LINE>
    <LINE>why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:</LINE>
    <LINE>--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved</LINE>
    <LINE>Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and</LINE>
    <LINE>die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live</LINE>
    <LINE>all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;</LINE>
    <LINE>as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was</LINE>
    <LINE>valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I</LINE>
    <LINE>slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his</LINE>
    <LINE>fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his</LINE>
    <LINE>ambition. Who is here so base that would be a</LINE>
    <LINE>bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.</LINE>
    <LINE>Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If</LINE>
    <LINE>any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so</LINE>
    <LINE>vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;</LINE>
    <LINE>for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.</LINE>

    <LINE>None, Brutus, none.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Then none have I offended. I have done no more to</LINE>
    <LINE>Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of</LINE>
    <LINE>his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not</LINE>
    <LINE>extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences</LINE>
    <LINE>enforced, for which he suffered death.</LINE>

    <LINE>Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,</LINE>
    <LINE>though he had no hand in his death, shall receive</LINE>
    <LINE>the benefit of his dying, a place in the</LINE>
    <LINE>commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this</LINE>
    <LINE>I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the</LINE>

    <LINE>You gentle Romans,--</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>Citizens</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Peace, ho! let us hear him.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;</LINE>
    <LINE>I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.</LINE>
    <LINE>The evil that men do lives after them;</LINE>
    <LINE>The good is oft interred with their bones;</LINE>
    <LINE>So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus</LINE>
    <LINE>Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:</LINE>
    <LINE>If it were so, it was a grievous fault,</LINE>
    <LINE>And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.</LINE>
    <LINE>Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--</LINE>
    <LINE>For Brutus is an honourable man;</LINE>
    <LINE>So are they all, all honourable men--</LINE>
    <LINE>Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.</LINE>
    <LINE>He was my friend, faithful and just to me:</LINE>
    <LINE>But Brutus says he was ambitious;</LINE>
    <LINE>And Brutus is an honourable man.</LINE>
    <LINE>He hath brought many captives home to Rome</LINE>
    <LINE>Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:</LINE>
    <LINE>Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?</LINE>
    <LINE>When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:</LINE>
    <LINE>Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:</LINE>
    <LINE>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</LINE>
    <LINE>And Brutus is an honourable man.</LINE>
    <LINE>You all did see that on the Lupercal</LINE>
    <LINE>I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</LINE>
    <LINE>Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?</LINE>
    <LINE>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</LINE>
    <LINE>And, sure, he is an honourable man.</LINE>
    <LINE>I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,</LINE>
    <LINE>But here I am to speak what I do know.</LINE>
    <LINE>You all did love him once, not without cause:</LINE>
    <LINE>What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?</LINE>
    <LINE>O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,</LINE>
    <LINE>And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;</LINE>
    <LINE>My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,</LINE>
    <LINE>And I must pause till it come back to me.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>If thou consider rightly of the matter,</LINE>
    <LINE>Caesar has had great wrong.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Has he, masters?</LINE>
    <LINE>I fear there will a worse come in his place.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>Fourth Citizen</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;</LINE>
    <LINE>Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>If it be found so, some will dear abide it.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>Fourth Citizen</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Now mark him, he begins again to speak.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>But yesterday the word of Caesar might</LINE>
    <LINE>Have stood against the world; now lies he there.</LINE>
    <LINE>And none so poor to do him reverence.</LINE>
    <LINE>O masters, if I were disposed to stir</LINE>
    <LINE>Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,</LINE>
    <LINE>I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,</LINE>
    <LINE>Who, you all know, are honourable men:</LINE>
    <LINE>I will not do them wrong; I rather choose</LINE>
    <LINE>To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,</LINE>
    <LINE>Than I will wrong such honourable men.</LINE>
    <LINE>But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;</LINE>
    <LINE>I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:</LINE>
    <LINE>Let but the commons hear this testament--</LINE>
    <LINE>Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--</LINE>
    <LINE>And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds</LINE>
    <LINE>And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,</LINE>
    <LINE>Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,</LINE>
    <LINE>And, dying, mention it within their wills,</LINE>
    <LINE>Bequeathing it as a rich legacy</LINE>
    <LINE>Unto their issue.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>Fourth Citizen</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>

    <LINE>The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;</LINE>
    <LINE>It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.</LINE>
    <LINE>You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;</LINE>
    <LINE>And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,</LINE>
    <LINE>It will inflame you, it will make you mad:</LINE>
    <LINE>'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;</LINE>
    <LINE>For, if you should, O, what would come of it!</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>Fourth Citizen</SPEAKER>

    <LINE>Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?</LINE>
    <LINE>I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:</LINE>

    <LINE>Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.</LINE>

    <LINE>If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.</LINE>
    <LINE>You all do know this mantle: I remember</LINE>
    <LINE>The first time ever Caesar put it on;</LINE>
    <LINE>'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,</LINE>
    <LINE>That day he overcame the Nervii:</LINE>
    <LINE>Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:</LINE>
    <LINE>See what a rent the envious Casca made:</LINE>
    <LINE>Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;</LINE>
    <LINE>And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,</LINE>
    <LINE>Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,</LINE>
    <LINE>As rushing out of doors, to be resolved</LINE>
    <LINE>If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;</LINE>
    <LINE>For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:</LINE>
    <LINE>Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!</LINE>
    <LINE>This was the most unkindest cut of all;</LINE>
    <LINE>For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,</LINE>
    <LINE>Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,</LINE>
    <LINE>Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;</LINE>
    <LINE>And, in his mantle muffling up his face,</LINE>
    <LINE>Even at the base of Pompey's statua,</LINE>
    <LINE>Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.</LINE>
    <LINE>O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!</LINE>
    <LINE>Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,</LINE>
    <LINE>Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.</LINE>
    <LINE>O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel</LINE>
    <LINE>The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.</LINE>
    <LINE>Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold</LINE>

    <LINE>I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:</LINE>

    <LINE>That love my friend; and that they know full well</LINE>

    <LINE>For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,</LINE>
    <LINE>Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,</LINE>

    <LINE>I tell you that which you yourselves do know;</LINE>

    <LINE>One of the three to share it?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>

    <LINE>In our black sentence and proscription.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Octavius, I have seen more days than you:</LINE>
    <LINE>And though we lay these honours on this man,</LINE>
    <LINE>To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,</LINE>
    <LINE>He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,</LINE>
    <LINE>To groan and sweat under the business,</LINE>
    <LINE>Either led or driven, as we point the way;</LINE>
    <LINE>And having brought our treasure where we will,</LINE>
    <LINE>Then take we down his load, and turn him off,</LINE>
    <LINE>Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,</LINE>
    <LINE>And graze in commons.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>You may do your will;</LINE>
    <LINE>But he's a tried and valiant soldier.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>So is my horse, Octavius; and for that</LINE>
    <LINE>I do appoint him store of provender:</LINE>
    <LINE>It is a creature that I teach to fight,</LINE>
    <LINE>To wind, to stop, to run directly on,</LINE>
    <LINE>His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.</LINE>
    <LINE>And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;</LINE>
    <LINE>He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;</LINE>
    <LINE>A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds</LINE>
    <LINE>On abjects, orts and imitations,</LINE>
    <LINE>Which, out of use and staled by other men,</LINE>
    <LINE>Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,</LINE>
    <LINE>But as a property. And now, Octavius,</LINE>
    <LINE>Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius</LINE>
    <LINE>Are levying powers: we must straight make head:</LINE>
    <LINE>Therefore let our alliance be combined,</LINE>
    <LINE>Our best friends made, our means stretch'd</LINE>
    <LINE>And let us presently go sit in council,</LINE>
    <LINE>How covert matters may be best disclosed,</LINE>
    <LINE>And open perils surest answered.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Let us do so: for we are at the stake,</LINE>

    <LINE>Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,</LINE>

    <LINE>Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;</LINE>
    <LINE>Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,</LINE>
    <LINE>Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,</LINE>
    <LINE>To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep</LINE>
    <LINE>My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,</LINE>
    <LINE>And here my naked breast; within, a heart</LINE>
    <LINE>Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:</LINE>
    <LINE>If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;</LINE>
    <LINE>I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:</LINE>
    <LINE>Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,</LINE>

    <LINE>Your reason?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>This it is:</LINE>
    <LINE>'Tis better that the enemy seek us:</LINE>
    <LINE>So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,</LINE>
    <LINE>Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,</LINE>
    <LINE>Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.</LINE>

    <LINE>Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.</LINE>
    <LINE>The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground</LINE>
    <LINE>Do stand but in a forced affection;</LINE>
    <LINE>For they have grudged us contribution:</LINE>
    <LINE>The enemy, marching along by them,</LINE>
    <LINE>By them shall make a fuller number up,</LINE>
    <LINE>Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;</LINE>
    <LINE>From which advantage shall we cut him off,</LINE>

    <LINE>We, at the height, are ready to decline.</LINE>
    <LINE>There is a tide in the affairs of men,</LINE>
    <LINE>Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;</LINE>
    <LINE>Omitted, all the voyage of their life</LINE>
    <LINE>Is bound in shallows and in miseries.</LINE>
    <LINE>On such a full sea are we now afloat;</LINE>
    <LINE>And we must take the current when it serves,</LINE>
    <LINE>Or lose our ventures.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>

    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Messala,</LINE>
    <LINE>This is my birth-day; as this very day</LINE>
    <LINE>Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:</LINE>
    <LINE>Be thou my witness that against my will,</LINE>
    <LINE>As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set</LINE>
    <LINE>Upon one battle all our liberties.</LINE>
    <LINE>You know that I held Epicurus strong</LINE>
    <LINE>And his opinion: now I change my mind,</LINE>
    <LINE>And partly credit things that do presage.</LINE>
    <LINE>Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign</LINE>
    <LINE>Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,</LINE>
    <LINE>Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;</LINE>
    <LINE>Who to Philippi here consorted us:</LINE>
    <LINE>This morning are they fled away and gone;</LINE>
    <LINE>And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,</LINE>
    <LINE>Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,</LINE>
    <LINE>As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem</LINE>
    <LINE>A canopy most fatal, under which</LINE>
    <LINE>Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Believe not so.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I but believe it partly;</LINE>
    <LINE>For I am fresh of spirit and resolved</LINE>

    <LINE>Even so, Lucilius.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Now, most noble Brutus,</LINE>
    <LINE>The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,</LINE>
    <LINE>Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!</LINE>
    <LINE>But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,</LINE>
    <LINE>Let's reason with the worst that may befall.</LINE>
    <LINE>If we do lose this battle, then is this</LINE>
    <LINE>The very last time we shall speak together:</LINE>
    <LINE>What are you then determined to do?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Even by the rule of that philosophy</LINE>
    <LINE>By which I did blame Cato for the death</LINE>
    <LINE>Which he did give himself, I know not how,</LINE>
    <LINE>But I do find it cowardly and vile,</LINE>
    <LINE>For fear of what might fall, so to prevent</LINE>
    <LINE>The time of life: arming myself with patience</LINE>
    <LINE>To stay the providence of some high powers</LINE>
    <LINE>That govern us below.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Then, if we lose this battle,</LINE>
    <LINE>You are contented to be led in triumph</LINE>
    <LINE>Thorough the streets of Rome?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,</LINE>
    <LINE>That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;</LINE>
    <LINE>He bears too great a mind. But this same day</LINE>
    <LINE>Must end that work the ides of March begun;</LINE>
    <LINE>And whether we shall meet again I know not.</LINE>
    <LINE>Therefore our everlasting farewell take:</LINE>
    <LINE>For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!</LINE>
    <LINE>If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;</LINE>
    <LINE>If not, why then, this parting was well made.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!</LINE>
    <LINE>If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;</LINE>
    <LINE>If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know</LINE>
    <LINE>The end of this day's business ere it come!</LINE>
    <LINE>But it sufficeth that the day will end,</LINE>
    <LINE>And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!</LINE>

    <LINE>Why, this, Volumnius:</LINE>
    <LINE>The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me</LINE>
    <LINE>Two several times by night; at Sardis once,</LINE>
    <LINE>And, this last night, here in Philippi fields:</LINE>

    <LINE>Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.</LINE>
    <LINE>Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;</LINE>
    <LINE>Our enemies have beat us to the pit:</LINE>
    <STAGEDIR>Low alarums</STAGEDIR>
    <LINE>It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,</LINE>
    <LINE>Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,</LINE>
    <LINE>Thou know'st that we two went to school together:</LINE>
    <LINE>Even for that our love of old, I prithee,</LINE>
    <LINE>Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>VOLUMNIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>That's not an office for a friend, my lord.</LINE>

    <LINE>Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.</LINE>
    <LINE>Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;</LINE>
    <LINE>Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,</LINE>
    <LINE>My heart doth joy that yet in all my life</LINE>
    <LINE>I found no man but he was true to me.</LINE>
    <LINE>I shall have glory by this losing day</LINE>
    <LINE>More than Octavius and Mark Antony</LINE>
    <LINE>By this vile conquest shall attain unto.</LINE>
    <LINE>So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue</LINE>
    <LINE>Hath almost ended his life's history:</LINE>
    <LINE>Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,</LINE>

    <LINE>Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:</LINE>
    <LINE>Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,</LINE>

    <SPEAKER>STRATO</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:</LINE>
    <LINE>The conquerors can but make a fire of him;</LINE>
    <LINE>For Brutus only overcame himself,</LINE>
    <LINE>And no man else hath honour by his death.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>LUCILIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,</LINE>

    <SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.</LINE>

    <LINE>Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>

    <LINE>Do so, good Messala.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>

    <LINE>How died my master, Strato?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>STRATO</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I held the sword, and he did run on it.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Octavius, then take him to follow thee,</LINE>
    <LINE>That did the latest service to my master.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>This was the noblest Roman of them all:</LINE>
    <LINE>All the conspirators save only he</LINE>
    <LINE>Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;</LINE>
    <LINE>He only, in a general honest thought</LINE>
    <LINE>And common good to all, made one of them.</LINE>
    <LINE>His life was gentle, and the elements</LINE>
    <LINE>So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up</LINE>
    <LINE>And say to all the world 'This was a man!'</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>According to his virtue let us use him,</LINE>
    <LINE>With all respect and rites of burial.</LINE>
    <LINE>Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,</LINE>
    <LINE>Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.</LINE>
    <LINE>So call the field to rest; and let's away,</LINE>
    <LINE>To part the glories of this happy day.</LINE>

  <LINE>It must be by his death: and for my part,</LINE>

  <LINE>It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;</LINE>

  <LINE>That at his will he may do danger with.</LINE>
  <LINE>The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins</LINE>

  <LINE>Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees</LINE>
  <LINE>By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.</LINE>
  <LINE>Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel</LINE>
  <LINE>Will bear no colour for the thing he is,</LINE>
  <LINE>Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,</LINE>

  <LINE>--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved</LINE>

  <LINE>slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his</LINE>

  <LINE>The first time ever Caesar put it on;</LINE>
  <LINE>'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,</LINE>
  <LINE>That day he overcame the Nervii:</LINE>
  <LINE>Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:</LINE>
  <LINE>See what a rent the envious Casca made:</LINE>
  <LINE>Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;</LINE>
  <LINE>And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,</LINE>

  <LINE>As rushing out of doors, to be resolved</LINE>
  <LINE>If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;</LINE>
  <LINE>For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:</LINE>
  <LINE>Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!</LINE>
  <LINE>This was the most unkindest cut of all;</LINE>
  <LINE>For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,</LINE>
  <LINE>Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,</LINE>
  <LINE>Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;</LINE>
  <LINE>And, in his mantle muffling up his face,</LINE>
  <LINE>Even at the base of Pompey's statua,</LINE>
  <LINE>Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.</LINE>
  <LINE>O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!</LINE>

<LINE>Brutus, I do observe you now of late:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1228 -->
<LINE>I have not from your eyes that gentleness</LINE>
<!-- Node #1229 -->
<LINE>And show of love as I was wont to have:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1230 -->
<LINE>You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand</LINE>
<!-- Node #1231 -->
<LINE>Over your friend that loves you.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1232 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1233 -->
<LINE>Cassius,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1234 -->
<LINE>Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1235 -->
<LINE>I turn the trouble of my countenance</LINE>
<!-- Node #1236 -->
<LINE>Merely upon myself. Vexed I am</LINE>
<!-- Node #1237 -->
<LINE>Of late with passions of some difference,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1238 -->
<LINE>Conceptions only proper to myself,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1239 -->
<LINE>Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1240 -->
<LINE>But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--</LINE>
<!-- Node #1241 -->
<LINE>Among which number, Cassius, be you one--</LINE>
<!-- Node #1242 -->
<LINE>Nor construe any further my neglect,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1243 -->
<LINE>Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1244 -->
<LINE>Forgets the shows of love to other men.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1245 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1246 -->
<LINE>Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1247 -->
<LINE>By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried</LINE>
<!-- Node #1248 -->
<LINE>Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1249 -->
<LINE>Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1250 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1251 -->
<LINE>No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1252 -->
<LINE>But by reflection, by some other things.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1253 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1254 -->
<LINE>'Tis just:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1255 -->
<LINE>And it is very much lamented, Brutus,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1256 -->
<LINE>That you have no such mirrors as will turn</LINE>
<!-- Node #1257 -->
<LINE>Your hidden worthiness into your eye,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1258 -->
<LINE>That you might see your shadow. I have heard,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1259 -->
<LINE>Where many of the best respect in Rome,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1260 -->
<LINE>Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus</LINE>
<!-- Node #1261 -->
<LINE>And groaning underneath this age's yoke,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1262 -->
<LINE>Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1263 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1264 -->
<LINE>Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1265 -->
<LINE>That you would have me seek into myself</LINE>
<!-- Node #1266 -->
<LINE>For that which is not in me?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1267 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1268 -->
<LINE>Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1269 -->
<LINE>And since you know you cannot see yourself</LINE>
<!-- Node #1270 -->
<LINE>So well as by reflection, I, your glass,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1271 -->
<LINE>Will modestly discover to yourself</LINE>
<!-- Node #1272 -->
<LINE>That of yourself which you yet know not of.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1273 -->
<LINE>And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1274 -->
<LINE>Were I a common laugher, or did use</LINE>
<!-- Node #1275 -->
<LINE>To stale with ordinary oaths my love</LINE>
<!-- Node #1276 -->
<LINE>To every new protester; if you know</LINE>
<!-- Node #1277 -->
<LINE>That I do fawn on men and hug them hard</LINE>
<!-- Node #1278 -->
<LINE>And after scandal them, or if you know</LINE>
<!-- Node #1279 -->
<LINE>That I profess myself in banqueting</LINE>
<!-- Node #1280 -->
<LINE>To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1281 -->
Flourish, and shout
<!-- Node #1282 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1283 -->
<LINE>What means this shouting? I do fear, the people</LINE>
<!-- Node #1284 -->
<LINE>Choose Caesar for their king.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1285 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1286 -->
<LINE>Ay, do you fear it?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1287 -->
<LINE>Then must I think you would not have it so.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1288 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1289 -->
<LINE>I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1290 -->
<LINE>But wherefore do you hold me here so long?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1291 -->
<LINE>What is it that you would impart to me?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1292 -->
<LINE>If it be aught toward the general good,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1293 -->
<LINE>Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1294 -->
<LINE>And I will look on both indifferently,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1295 -->
<LINE>For let the gods so speed me as I love</LINE>
<!-- Node #1296 -->
<LINE>The name of honour more than I fear death.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1297 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1298 -->
<LINE>I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1299 -->
<LINE>As well as I do know your outward favour.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1300 -->
<LINE>Well, honour is the subject of my story.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1301 -->
<LINE>I cannot tell what you and other men</LINE>
<!-- Node #1302 -->
<LINE>Think of this life; but, for my single self,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1303 -->
<LINE>I had as lief not be as live to be</LINE>
<!-- Node #1304 -->
<LINE>In awe of such a thing as I myself.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1305 -->
<LINE>I was born free as Caesar; so were you:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1306 -->
<LINE>We both have fed as well, and we can both</LINE>
<!-- Node #1307 -->
<LINE>Endure the winter's cold as well as he:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1308 -->
<LINE>For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1309 -->
<LINE>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1310 -->
<LINE>Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now</LINE>
<!-- Node #1311 -->
<LINE>Leap in with me into this angry flood,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1312 -->
<LINE>And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1313 -->
<LINE>Accoutred as I was, I plunged in</LINE>
<!-- Node #1314 -->
<LINE>And bade him follow; so indeed he did.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1315 -->
<LINE>The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it</LINE>
<!-- Node #1316 -->
<LINE>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</LINE>
<!-- Node #1317 -->
<LINE>And stemming it with hearts of controversy;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1318 -->
<LINE>But ere we could arrive the point proposed,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1319 -->
<LINE>Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'</LINE>
<!-- Node #1320 -->
<LINE>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1321 -->
<LINE>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</LINE>
<!-- Node #1322 -->
<LINE>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</LINE>
<!-- Node #1323 -->
<LINE>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</LINE>
<!-- Node #1324 -->
<LINE>Is now become a god, and Cassius is</LINE>
<!-- Node #1325 -->
<LINE>A wretched creature and must bend his body,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1326 -->
<LINE>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1327 -->
<LINE>He had a fever when he was in Spain,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1328 -->
<LINE>And when the fit was on him, I did mark</LINE>
<!-- Node #1329 -->
<LINE>How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1330 -->
<LINE>His coward lips did from their colour fly,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1331 -->
<LINE>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</LINE>
<!-- Node #1332 -->
<LINE>Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1333 -->
<LINE>Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans</LINE>
<!-- Node #1334 -->
<LINE>Mark him and write his speeches in their books,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1335 -->
<LINE>Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'</LINE>
<!-- Node #1336 -->
<LINE>As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me</LINE>
<!-- Node #1337 -->
<LINE>A man of such a feeble temper should</LINE>
<!-- Node #1338 -->
<LINE>So get the start of the majestic world</LINE>
<!-- Node #1339 -->
<LINE>And bear the palm alone.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1340 -->
Shout. Flourish
<!-- Node #1341 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1342 -->
<LINE>Another general shout!</LINE>
<!-- Node #1343 -->
<LINE>I do believe that these applauses are</LINE>
<!-- Node #1344 -->
<LINE>For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1345 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1346 -->
<LINE>Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</LINE>
<!-- Node #1347 -->
<LINE>Like a Colossus, and we petty men</LINE>
<!-- Node #1348 -->
<LINE>Walk under his huge legs and peep about</LINE>
<!-- Node #1349 -->
<LINE>To find ourselves dishonourable graves.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1350 -->
<LINE>Men at some time are masters of their fates:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1351 -->
<LINE>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1352 -->
<LINE>But in ourselves, that we are underlings.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1353 -->
<LINE>Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1354 -->
<LINE>Why should that name be sounded more than yours?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1355 -->
<LINE>Write them together, yours is as fair a name;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1356 -->
<LINE>Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1357 -->
<LINE>Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1358 -->
<LINE>Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1359 -->
<LINE>Now, in the names of all the gods at once,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1360 -->
<LINE>Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1361 -->
<LINE>That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!</LINE>
<!-- Node #1362 -->
<LINE>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!</LINE>
<!-- Node #1363 -->
<LINE>When went there by an age, since the great flood,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1364 -->
<LINE>But it was famed with more than with one man?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1365 -->
<LINE>When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1366 -->
<LINE>That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1367 -->
<LINE>Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1368 -->
<LINE>When there is in it but one only man.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1369 -->
<LINE>O, you and I have heard our fathers say,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1370 -->
<LINE>There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd</LINE>
<!-- Node #1371 -->
<LINE>The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome</LINE>
<!-- Node #1372 -->
<LINE>As easily as a king.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1373 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1374 -->
<LINE>That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1375 -->
<LINE>What you would work me to, I have some aim:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1376 -->
<LINE>How I have thought of this and of these times,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1377 -->
<LINE>I shall recount hereafter; for this present,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1378 -->
<LINE>I would not, so with love I might entreat you,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1379 -->
<LINE>Be any further moved. What you have said</LINE>
<!-- Node #1380 -->
<LINE>I will consider; what you have to say</LINE>
<!-- Node #1381 -->
<LINE>I will with patience hear, and find a time</LINE>
<!-- Node #1382 -->
<LINE>Both meet to hear and answer such high things.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1383 -->
<LINE>Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1384 -->
<LINE>Brutus had rather be a villager</LINE>
<!-- Node #1385 -->
<LINE>Than to repute himself a son of Rome</LINE>
<!-- Node #1386 -->
<LINE>Under these hard conditions as this time</LINE>
<!-- Node #1387 -->
<LINE>Is like to lay upon us.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1388 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1389 -->
<LINE>I am glad that my weak words</LINE>
<!-- Node #1390 -->
<LINE>Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1391 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1392 -->
<LINE>The games are done and Caesar is returning.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1393 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1394 -->
<LINE>As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1395 -->
<LINE>And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you</LINE>
<!-- Node #1396 -->
<LINE>What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1397 -->
Re-enter CAESAR and his Train
<!-- Node #1398 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1399 -->
<LINE>I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1400 -->
<LINE>The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1401 -->
<LINE>And all the rest look like a chidden train:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1402 -->
<LINE>Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero</LINE>
<!-- Node #1403 -->
<LINE>Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes</LINE>
<!-- Node #1404 -->
<LINE>As we have seen him in the Capitol,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1405 -->
<LINE>Being cross'd in conference by some senators.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1406 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1407 -->
<LINE>Casca will tell us what the matter is.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1408 -->

<LINE>Caesar?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1412 -->
<SPEAKER>CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1413 -->
<LINE>Let me have men about me that are fat;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1414 -->
<LINE>Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1415 -->
<LINE>Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1416 -->
<LINE>He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1417 -->
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1418 -->
<LINE>Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1419 -->
<LINE>He is a noble Roman and well given.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1420 -->
<SPEAKER>CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1421 -->
<LINE>Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1422 -->
<LINE>Yet if my name were liable to fear,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1423 -->
<LINE>I do not know the man I should avoid</LINE>
<!-- Node #1424 -->
<LINE>So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1425 -->
<LINE>He is a great observer and he looks</LINE>
<!-- Node #1426 -->
<LINE>Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1427 -->
<LINE>As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1428 -->
<LINE>Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort</LINE>
<!-- Node #1429 -->
<LINE>As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit</LINE>
<!-- Node #1430 -->
<LINE>That could be moved to smile at any thing.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1431 -->
<LINE>Such men as he be never at heart's ease</LINE>
<!-- Node #1432 -->
<LINE>Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1433 -->
<LINE>And therefore are they very dangerous.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1434 -->
<LINE>I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd</LINE>
<!-- Node #1435 -->
<LINE>Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1436 -->
<LINE>Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1437 -->
<LINE>And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1438 -->
Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA
<!-- Node #1439 -->
<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1440 -->
<LINE>You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1441 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1442 -->
<LINE>Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1443 -->
<LINE>That Caesar looks so sad.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1444 -->
<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1445 -->
<LINE>Why, you were with him, were you not?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1446 -->

<LINE>I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1448 -->
<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1449 -->
<LINE>Why, there was a crown offered him: and being</LINE>
<!-- Node #1450 -->
<LINE>offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1451 -->
<LINE>thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1452 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1453 -->
<LINE>What was the second noise for?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1454 -->
<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1455 -->
<LINE>Why, for that too.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1456 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1457 -->
<LINE>They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1458 -->
<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1459 -->
<LINE>Why, for that too.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1460 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1461 -->
<LINE>Was the crown offered him thrice?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1462 -->
<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1463 -->
<LINE>Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every</LINE>
<!-- Node #1464 -->
<LINE>time gentler than other, and at every putting-by</LINE>
<!-- Node #1465 -->
<LINE>mine honest neighbours shouted.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1466 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1467 -->
<LINE>Who offered him the crown?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1468 -->
<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1469 -->
<LINE>Why, Antony.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1470 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1471 -->
<LINE>Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1472 -->
<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1473 -->
<LINE>I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1474 -->
<LINE>it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark</LINE>
<!-- Node #1475 -->
<LINE>Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown</LINE>
<!-- Node #1476 -->
<LINE>neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told</LINE>
<!-- Node #1477 -->
<LINE>you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my</LINE>
<!-- Node #1478 -->
<LINE>thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he</LINE>
<!-- Node #1479 -->
<LINE>offered it to him again; then he put it by again:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1480 -->
<LINE>but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his</LINE>
<!-- Node #1481 -->
<LINE>fingers off it. And then he offered it the third</LINE>
<!-- Node #1482 -->
<LINE>time; he put it the third time by: and still as he</LINE>
<!-- Node #1483 -->
<LINE>refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their</LINE>
<!-- Node #1484 -->
<LINE>chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps</LINE>
<!-- Node #1485 -->
<LINE>and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because</LINE>
<!-- Node #1486 -->
<LINE>Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked</LINE>
<!-- Node #1487 -->
<LINE>Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and</LINE>
<!-- Node #1488 -->
<LINE>for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of</LINE>
<!-- Node #1489 -->
<LINE>opening my lips and receiving the bad air.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1490 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1491 -->
<LINE>But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1492 -->
<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1493 -->
<LINE>He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at</LINE>
<!-- Node #1494 -->
<LINE>mouth, and was speechless.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1495 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1496 -->
<LINE>'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1497 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1498 -->
<LINE>No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1499 -->
<LINE>And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1500 -->
<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1501 -->
<LINE>I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1502 -->
<LINE>Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not</LINE>
<!-- Node #1503 -->
<LINE>clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and</LINE>
<!-- Node #1504 -->
<LINE>displeased them, as they use to do the players in</LINE>
<!-- Node #1505 -->
<LINE>the theatre, I am no true man.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1506 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1507 -->
<LINE>What said he when he came unto himself?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1508 -->
<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1509 -->
<LINE>Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the</LINE>
<!-- Node #1510 -->
<LINE>common herd was glad he refused the crown, he</LINE>
<!-- Node #1511 -->
<LINE>plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his</LINE>
<!-- Node #1512 -->
<LINE>throat to cut. An I had been a man of any</LINE>
<!-- Node #1513 -->
<LINE>occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1514 -->
<LINE>I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so</LINE>
<!-- Node #1515 -->
<LINE>he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1516 -->
<LINE>If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired</LINE>
<!-- Node #1517 -->
<LINE>their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three</LINE>
<!-- Node #1518 -->
<LINE>or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good</LINE>
<!-- Node #1519 -->
<LINE>soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but</LINE>
<!-- Node #1520 -->
<LINE>there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had</LINE>
<!-- Node #1521 -->
<LINE>stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1522 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1523 -->
<LINE>And after that, he came, thus sad, away?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1524 -->
<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1525 -->
<LINE>Ay.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1526 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1527 -->
<LINE>Did Cicero say any thing?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1528 -->
<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1529 -->
<LINE>Ay, he spoke Greek.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1530 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1531 -->
<LINE>To what effect?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1532 -->
<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1533 -->
<LINE>Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the</LINE>
<!-- Node #1534 -->
<LINE>face again: but those that understood him smiled at</LINE>
<!-- Node #1535 -->
<LINE>one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own</LINE>
<!-- Node #1536 -->
<LINE>part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more</LINE>
<!-- Node #1537 -->
<LINE>news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs</LINE>
<!-- Node #1538 -->
<LINE>off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you</LINE>
<!-- Node #1539 -->
<LINE>well. There was more foolery yet, if I could</LINE>

<LINE>remember it.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1541 -->

<LINE>Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?</LINE>

<!-- Node #1597 -->
<LINE>I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds</LINE>
<!-- Node #1598 -->
<LINE>Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen</LINE>

<LINE>The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1600 -->
<LINE>To be exalted with the threatening clouds:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1601 -->
<LINE>But never till to-night, never till now,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1602 -->
<LINE>Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.</LINE>

<LINE>A common slave--you know him well by sight--</LINE>

<LINE>Who glared upon me, and went surly by,</LINE>

<LINE>Without annoying me: and there were drawn</LINE>

<LINE>And yesterday the bird of night did sit</LINE>

<LINE>Who ever knew the heavens menace so?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1654 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1655 -->
<LINE>Those that have known the earth so full of faults.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1656 -->
<LINE>For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1657 -->
<LINE>Submitting me unto the perilous night,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1658 -->
<LINE>And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1659 -->
<LINE>Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1660 -->
<LINE>And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open</LINE>
<!-- Node #1661 -->
<LINE>The breast of heaven, I did present myself</LINE>
<!-- Node #1662 -->
<LINE>Even in the aim and very flash of it.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1663 -->
<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1664 -->
<LINE>But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1665 -->
<LINE>It is the part of men to fear and tremble,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1666 -->
<LINE>When the most mighty gods by tokens send</LINE>
<!-- Node #1667 -->
<LINE>Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1668 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1669 -->
<LINE>You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life</LINE>
<!-- Node #1670 -->
<LINE>That should be in a Roman you do want,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1671 -->
<LINE>Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze</LINE>
<!-- Node #1672 -->
<LINE>And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1673 -->
<LINE>To see the strange impatience of the heavens:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1674 -->
<LINE>But if you would consider the true cause</LINE>
<!-- Node #1675 -->
<LINE>Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1676 -->
<LINE>Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1677 -->
<LINE>Why old men fool and children calculate,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1678 -->
<LINE>Why all these things change from their ordinance</LINE>
<!-- Node #1679 -->
<LINE>Their natures and preformed faculties</LINE>
<!-- Node #1680 -->
<LINE>To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find</LINE>
<!-- Node #1681 -->
<LINE>That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1682 -->
<LINE>To make them instruments of fear and warning</LINE>
<!-- Node #1683 -->
<LINE>Unto some monstrous state.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1684 -->
<LINE>Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man</LINE>
<!-- Node #1685 -->
<LINE>Most like this dreadful night,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1686 -->
<LINE>That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars</LINE>
<!-- Node #1687 -->
<LINE>As doth the lion in the Capitol,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1688 -->
<LINE>A man no mightier than thyself or me</LINE>
<!-- Node #1689 -->
<LINE>In personal action, yet prodigious grown</LINE>
<!-- Node #1690 -->
<LINE>And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1691 -->
<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1692 -->
<LINE>'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1693 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1694 -->
<LINE>Let it be who it is: for Romans now</LINE>
<!-- Node #1695 -->
<LINE>Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1696 -->
<LINE>But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1697 -->
<LINE>And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1698 -->
<LINE>Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1699 -->
<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1700 -->
<LINE>Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow</LINE>
<!-- Node #1701 -->
<LINE>Mean to establish Caesar as a king;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1702 -->
<LINE>And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1703 -->
<LINE>In every place, save here in Italy.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1704 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1705 -->
<LINE>I know where I will wear this dagger then;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1706 -->
<LINE>Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1707 -->
<LINE>Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1708 -->
<LINE>Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1709 -->
<LINE>Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1710 -->
<LINE>Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1711 -->
<LINE>Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1712 -->
<LINE>But life, being weary of these worldly bars,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1713 -->
<LINE>Never lacks power to dismiss itself.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1714 -->
<LINE>If I know this, know all the world besides,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1715 -->
<LINE>That part of tyranny that I do bear</LINE>
<!-- Node #1716 -->
<LINE>I can shake off at pleasure.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1717 -->
Thunder still
<!-- Node #1718 -->
<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1719 -->
<LINE>So can I:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1720 -->
<LINE>So every bondman in his own hand bears</LINE>
<!-- Node #1721 -->
<LINE>The power to cancel his captivity.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1722 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1723 -->
<LINE>And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?</LINE>
<!-- Node #1724 -->
<LINE>Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1725 -->
<LINE>But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1726 -->
<LINE>He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1727 -->
<LINE>Those that with haste will make a mighty fire</LINE>
<!-- Node #1728 -->
<LINE>Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1729 -->
<LINE>What rubbish and what offal, when it serves</LINE>
<!-- Node #1730 -->
<LINE>For the base matter to illuminate</LINE>
<!-- Node #1731 -->
<LINE>So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1732 -->
<LINE>Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this</LINE>
<!-- Node #1733 -->
<LINE>Before a willing bondman; then I know</LINE>
<!-- Node #1734 -->
<LINE>My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1735 -->
<LINE>And dangers are to me indifferent.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1736 -->
<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1737 -->
<LINE>You speak to Casca, and to such a man</LINE>
<!-- Node #1738 -->
<LINE>That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1739 -->
<LINE>Be factious for redress of all these griefs,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1740 -->
<LINE>And I will set this foot of mine as far</LINE>
<!-- Node #1741 -->
<LINE>As who goes farthest.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1742 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1743 -->
<LINE>There's a bargain made.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1744 -->
<LINE>Now know you, Casca, I have moved already</LINE>
<!-- Node #1745 -->
<LINE>Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans</LINE>
<!-- Node #1746 -->
<LINE>To undergo with me an enterprise</LINE>
<!-- Node #1747 -->
<LINE>Of honourable-dangerous consequence;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1748 -->
<LINE>And I do know, by this, they stay for me</LINE>
<!-- Node #1749 -->
<LINE>In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1750 -->
<LINE>There is no stir or walking in the streets;</LINE>

<LINE>O Cassius, if you could</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1776 -->
<LINE>Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,</LINE>

<!-- Node #1778 -->
<LINE>Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this</LINE>
<!-- Node #1779 -->
<LINE>In at his window; set this up with wax</LINE>
<!-- Node #1780 -->
<LINE>Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1781 -->
<LINE>Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CINNA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1784 -->
<LINE>All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone</LINE>
<!-- Node #1785 -->
<LINE>To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,</LINE>

<LINE>And so bestow these papers as you bade me.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1787 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1788 -->
<LINE>That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1789 -->
<STAGEDIR>Exit CINNA</STAGEDIR>
<!-- Node #1790 -->
<LINE>Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day</LINE>

<LINE>See Brutus at his house: three parts of him</LINE>
<!-- Node #1792 -->
<LINE>Is ours already, and the man entire</LINE>
<!-- Node #1793 -->
<LINE>Upon the next encounter yields him ours.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1794 -->
<SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1795 -->
<LINE>O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1796 -->
<LINE>And that which would appear offence in us,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1797 -->
<LINE>His countenance, like richest alchemy,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1798 -->
<LINE>Will change to virtue and to worthiness.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1799 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1800 -->
<LINE>Him and his worth and our great need of him</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1808 -->
<LINE>What, Lucius, ho!</LINE>
<!-- Node #1809 -->
<LINE>I cannot, by the progress of the stars,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1810 -->
<LINE>Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!</LINE>

<LINE>I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.</LINE>

<LINE>Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1818 -->
<LINE>When it is lighted, come and call me here.</LINE>

<LINE>I will, my lord.</LINE>

Exit

<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #1823 -->
<LINE>It must be by his death: and for my part,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1824 -->
<LINE>I know no personal cause to spurn at him,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1825 -->
<LINE>But for the general. He would be crown'd:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1826 -->
<LINE>How that might change his nature, there's the question.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1827 -->
<LINE>It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1828 -->
<LINE>And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--</LINE>
<!-- Node #1829 -->
<LINE>And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1830 -->
<LINE>That at his will he may do danger with.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1831 -->
<LINE>The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins</LINE>
<!-- Node #1832 -->
<LINE>Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1833 -->
<LINE>I have not known when his affections sway'd</LINE>
<!-- Node #1834 -->
<LINE>More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1835 -->
<LINE>That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1836 -->
<LINE>Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;</LINE>
<!-- Node #1837 -->
<LINE>But when he once attains the upmost round.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1838 -->
<LINE>He then unto the ladder turns his back,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1839 -->
<LINE>Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees</LINE>
<!-- Node #1840 -->
<LINE>By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.</LINE>
<!-- Node #1841 -->
<LINE>Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel</LINE>
<!-- Node #1842 -->
<LINE>Will bear no colour for the thing he is,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1843 -->
<LINE>Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1844 -->
<LINE>Would run to these and these extremities:</LINE>
<!-- Node #1845 -->
<LINE>And therefore think him as a serpent's egg</LINE>
<!-- Node #1846 -->
<LINE>Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,</LINE>
<!-- Node #1847 -->
<LINE>And kill him in the shell.</LINE>

<!-- Node #1878 -->
<LINE>'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated</LINE>

<LINE>To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:</LINE>

<SPEAKER>METELLUS CIMBER</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #2008 -->
<LINE>O, let us have him, for his silver hairs</LINE>
<!-- Node #2009 -->
<LINE>Will purchase us a good opinion</LINE>

<LINE>Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2026 -->
<LINE>Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2027 -->
<LINE>Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him</LINE>
<!-- Node #2028 -->
<LINE>A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2029 -->
<LINE>If he improve them, may well stretch so far</LINE>
<!-- Node #2030 -->
<LINE>As to annoy us all: which to prevent,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2031 -->
<LINE>Let Antony and Caesar fall together.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2032 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #2033 -->
<LINE>Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2034 -->
<LINE>To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2035 -->
<LINE>Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2036 -->
<LINE>For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:</LINE>
<!-- Node #2037 -->
<LINE>Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2038 -->
<LINE>We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2039 -->
<LINE>And in the spirit of men there is no blood:</LINE>
<!-- Node #2040 -->
<LINE>O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2041 -->
<LINE>And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2042 -->
<LINE>Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2043 -->
<LINE>Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2044 -->
<LINE>Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2045 -->
<LINE>Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:</LINE>
<!-- Node #2046 -->
<LINE>And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2047 -->
<LINE>Stir up their servants to an act of rage,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2048 -->
<LINE>And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make</LINE>
<!-- Node #2049 -->
<LINE>Our purpose necessary and not envious:</LINE>
<!-- Node #2050 -->
<LINE>Which so appearing to the common eyes,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2051 -->
<LINE>We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2052 -->
<LINE>And for Mark Antony, think not of him;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2053 -->
<LINE>For he can do no more than Caesar's arm</LINE>
<!-- Node #2054 -->
<LINE>When Caesar's head is off.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2055 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #2056 -->
<LINE>Yet I fear him;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2057 -->
<LINE>For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--</LINE>
<!-- Node #2058 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #2059 -->
<LINE>Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:</LINE>
<!-- Node #2060 -->
<LINE>If he love Caesar, all that he can do</LINE>
<!-- Node #2061 -->
<LINE>Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:</LINE>
<!-- Node #2062 -->
<LINE>And that were much he should; for he is given</LINE>
<!-- Node #2063 -->
<LINE>To sports, to wildness and much company.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2064 -->
<SPEAKER>TREBONIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #2065 -->
<LINE>There is no fear in him; let him not die;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2066 -->
<LINE>For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #2069 -->
<LINE>Peace! count the clock.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2070 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #2071 -->
<LINE>The clock hath stricken three.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>TREBONIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #2073 -->
<LINE>'Tis time to part.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2074 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #2075 -->
<LINE>But it is doubtful yet,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2076 -->
<LINE>Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2077 -->
<LINE>For he is superstitious grown of late,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2078 -->
<LINE>Quite from the main opinion he held once</LINE>
<!-- Node #2079 -->
<LINE>Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:</LINE>
<!-- Node #2080 -->
<LINE>It may be, these apparent prodigies,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2081 -->
<LINE>The unaccustom'd terror of this night,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2082 -->
<LINE>And the persuasion of his augurers,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2083 -->
<LINE>May hold him from the Capitol to-day.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2084 -->
<SPEAKER>DECIUS BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #2085 -->
<LINE>Never fear that: if he be so resolved,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2086 -->
<LINE>I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear</LINE>
<!-- Node #2087 -->
<LINE>That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2088 -->
<LINE>And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2089 -->
<LINE>Lions with toils and men with flatterers;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2090 -->
<LINE>But when I tell him he hates flatterers,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2091 -->
<LINE>He says he does, being then most flattered.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2092 -->
<LINE>Let me work;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2093 -->
<LINE>For I can give his humour the true bent,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2094 -->
<LINE>And I will bring him to the Capitol.</LINE>

<LINE>It is not for your health thus to commit</LINE>
<!-- Node #2131 -->
<LINE>Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2132 -->
<SPEAKER>PORTIA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #2133 -->
<LINE>Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2134 -->
<LINE>Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2135 -->
<LINE>You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2136 -->
<LINE>Musing and sighing, with your arms across,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2137 -->
<LINE>And when I ask'd you what the matter was,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2138 -->
<LINE>You stared upon me with ungentle looks;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2139 -->
<LINE>I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2140 -->
<LINE>And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2141 -->
<LINE>Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2142 -->
<LINE>But, with an angry wafture of your hand,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2143 -->
<LINE>Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2144 -->
<LINE>Fearing to strengthen that impatience</LINE>
<!-- Node #2145 -->
<LINE>Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal</LINE>
<!-- Node #2146 -->
<LINE>Hoping it was but an effect of humour,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2147 -->
<LINE>Which sometime hath his hour with every man.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2148 -->
<LINE>It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2149 -->
<LINE>And could it work so much upon your shape</LINE>
<!-- Node #2150 -->
<LINE>As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2151 -->
<LINE>I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,</LINE>

<!-- Node #2159 -->
<LINE>Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2160 -->
<SPEAKER>PORTIA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #2161 -->
<LINE>Is Brutus sick? and is it physical</LINE>
<!-- Node #2162 -->
<LINE>To walk unbraced and suck up the humours</LINE>
<!-- Node #2163 -->
<LINE>Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2164 -->
<LINE>And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2165 -->
<LINE>To dare the vile contagion of the night</LINE>
<!-- Node #2166 -->
<LINE>And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air</LINE>
<!-- Node #2167 -->
<LINE>To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;</LINE>

<LINE>You have some sick offence within your mind,</LINE>

<LINE>To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,</LINE>

<LINE>Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:</LINE>

<LINE>Giving myself a voluntary wound</LINE>
<!-- Node #2206 -->
<LINE>Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2207 -->
<LINE>And not my husband's secrets?</LINE>

<LINE>Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2378 -->
<LINE>In which so many smiling Romans bathed,</LINE>

<!-- Node #2381 -->
<LINE>For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.</LINE>

<LINE>Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:</LINE>
<!-- Node #2739 -->
<LINE>Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;</LINE>

<LINE>And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:</LINE>
<!-- Node #2741 -->
<LINE>Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2742 -->
<LINE>Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:</LINE>
<!-- Node #2743 -->
<LINE>Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2744 -->

<!-- Node #2745 -->
<LINE>If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony</LINE>
<!-- Node #2746 -->
<LINE>May safely come to him, and be resolved</LINE>
<!-- Node #2747 -->
<LINE>How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2748 -->
<LINE>Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead</LINE>

<LINE>If I myself, there is no hour so fit</LINE>
<!-- Node #2779 -->
<LINE>As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument</LINE>
<!-- Node #2780 -->
<LINE>Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich</LINE>
<!-- Node #2781 -->
<LINE>With the most noble blood of all this world.</LINE>

<LINE>Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2784 -->
<LINE>Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,</LINE>

<LINE>I shall not find myself so apt to die:</LINE>
<!-- Node #2786 -->
<LINE>No place will please me so, no mean of death,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2787 -->
<LINE>As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,</LINE>

<LINE>O Antony, beg not your death of us.</LINE>

<LINE>As, by our hands and this our present act,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2793 -->
<LINE>You see we do, yet see you but our hands</LINE>
<!-- Node #2794 -->
<LINE>And this the bleeding business they have done:</LINE>

<LINE>Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2796 -->
<LINE>And pity to the general wrong of Rome--</LINE>
<!-- Node #2797 -->
<LINE>As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--</LINE>
<!-- Node #2798 -->
<LINE>Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2799 -->
<LINE>To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:</LINE>
<!-- Node #2800 -->
<LINE>Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts</LINE>
<!-- Node #2801 -->
<LINE>Of brothers' temper, do receive you in</LINE>
<!-- Node #2802 -->
<LINE>With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2803 -->

<LINE>Only be patient till we have appeased</LINE>
<!-- Node #2808 -->
<LINE>The multitude, beside themselves with fear,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2809 -->
<LINE>And then we will deliver you the cause,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2810 -->
<LINE>Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2811 -->
<LINE>Have thus proceeded.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2812 -->
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #2813 -->
<LINE>I doubt not of your wisdom.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2814 -->
<LINE>Let each man render me his bloody hand:</LINE>

<LINE>First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2816 -->
<LINE>Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2817 -->
<LINE>Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2818 -->
<LINE>Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2819 -->
<LINE>Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2820 -->
<LINE>Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?</LINE>
<!-- Node #2821 -->
<LINE>My credit now stands on such slippery ground,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2822 -->
<LINE>That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2823 -->
<LINE>Either a coward or a flatterer.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2824 -->
<LINE>That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:</LINE>
<!-- Node #2825 -->
<LINE>If then thy spirit look upon us now,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2826 -->
<LINE>Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2827 -->
<LINE>To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2828 -->
<LINE>Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2829 -->
<LINE>Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?</LINE>
<!-- Node #2830 -->
<LINE>Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2831 -->
<LINE>Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2832 -->
<LINE>It would become me better than to close</LINE>
<!-- Node #2833 -->
<LINE>In terms of friendship with thine enemies.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2834 -->
<LINE>Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2835 -->
<LINE>Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,</LINE>
<!-- Node #2836 -->
<LINE>Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2837 -->
<LINE>O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2838 -->
<LINE>And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2839 -->
<LINE>How like a deer, strucken by many princes,</LINE>

<!-- Node #2844 -->
<LINE>Pardon me, Caius Cassius:</LINE>
<!-- Node #2845 -->
<LINE>The enemies of Caesar shall say this;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2846 -->
<LINE>Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2847 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #2848 -->
<LINE>I blame you not for praising Caesar so;</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #2853 -->

<LINE>The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!</LINE>

<!-- Node #2980 -->
<LINE>Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my</LINE>

<!-- Node #2985 -->
<LINE>If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of</LINE>
<!-- Node #2986 -->
<LINE>Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar</LINE>
<!-- Node #2987 -->
<LINE>was no less than his. If then that friend demand</LINE>
<!-- Node #2988 -->
<LINE>why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:</LINE>
<!-- Node #2989 -->
<LINE>--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved</LINE>
<!-- Node #2990 -->
<LINE>Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and</LINE>
<!-- Node #2991 -->
<LINE>die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live</LINE>
<!-- Node #2992 -->
<LINE>all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;</LINE>
<!-- Node #2993 -->
<LINE>as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was</LINE>
<!-- Node #2994 -->
<LINE>valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I</LINE>
<!-- Node #2995 -->
<LINE>slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his</LINE>
<!-- Node #2996 -->
<LINE>fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his</LINE>
<!-- Node #2997 -->
<LINE>ambition. Who is here so base that would be a</LINE>
<!-- Node #2998 -->
<LINE>bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.</LINE>
<!-- Node #2999 -->
<LINE>Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If</LINE>

<LINE>Nay, that's certain:</LINE>

<LINE>Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.</LINE>

<LINE>You gentle Romans,--</LINE>
<!-- Node #3072 -->
<SPEAKER>Citizens</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #3073 -->
<LINE>Peace, ho! let us hear him.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3074 -->
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #3075 -->
<LINE>Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;</LINE>
<!-- Node #3076 -->
<LINE>I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3077 -->
<LINE>The evil that men do lives after them;</LINE>
<!-- Node #3078 -->
<LINE>The good is oft interred with their bones;</LINE>
<!-- Node #3079 -->
<LINE>So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus</LINE>
<!-- Node #3080 -->
<LINE>Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:</LINE>
<!-- Node #3081 -->
<LINE>If it were so, it was a grievous fault,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3082 -->
<LINE>And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3083 -->
<LINE>Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--</LINE>
<!-- Node #3084 -->
<LINE>For Brutus is an honourable man;</LINE>
<!-- Node #3085 -->
<LINE>So are they all, all honourable men--</LINE>
<!-- Node #3086 -->
<LINE>Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3087 -->
<LINE>He was my friend, faithful and just to me:</LINE>
<!-- Node #3088 -->
<LINE>But Brutus says he was ambitious;</LINE>
<!-- Node #3089 -->
<LINE>And Brutus is an honourable man.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3090 -->
<LINE>He hath brought many captives home to Rome</LINE>
<!-- Node #3091 -->
<LINE>Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:</LINE>
<!-- Node #3092 -->
<LINE>Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?</LINE>
<!-- Node #3093 -->
<LINE>When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:</LINE>
<!-- Node #3094 -->
<LINE>Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:</LINE>
<!-- Node #3095 -->
<LINE>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</LINE>
<!-- Node #3096 -->
<LINE>And Brutus is an honourable man.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3097 -->
<LINE>You all did see that on the Lupercal</LINE>
<!-- Node #3098 -->
<LINE>I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3099 -->
<LINE>Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?</LINE>
<!-- Node #3100 -->
<LINE>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</LINE>
<!-- Node #3101 -->
<LINE>And, sure, he is an honourable man.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3102 -->
<LINE>I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3103 -->
<LINE>But here I am to speak what I do know.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3104 -->
<LINE>You all did love him once, not without cause:</LINE>
<!-- Node #3105 -->
<LINE>What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?</LINE>
<!-- Node #3106 -->
<LINE>O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3107 -->
<LINE>And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;</LINE>
<!-- Node #3108 -->
<LINE>My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3109 -->
<LINE>And I must pause till it come back to me.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3110 -->
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #3111 -->
<LINE>Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3112 -->
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #3113 -->
<LINE>If thou consider rightly of the matter,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3114 -->
<LINE>Caesar has had great wrong.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3115 -->
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #3116 -->
<LINE>Has he, masters?</LINE>
<!-- Node #3117 -->
<LINE>I fear there will a worse come in his place.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3118 -->
<SPEAKER>Fourth Citizen</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #3119 -->
<LINE>Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;</LINE>
<!-- Node #3120 -->
<LINE>Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3121 -->
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #3122 -->
<LINE>If it be found so, some will dear abide it.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3123 -->
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #3124 -->
<LINE>Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3125 -->
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #3126 -->
<LINE>There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3127 -->
<SPEAKER>Fourth Citizen</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #3128 -->
<LINE>Now mark him, he begins again to speak.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3129 -->
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #3130 -->
<LINE>But yesterday the word of Caesar might</LINE>
<!-- Node #3131 -->
<LINE>Have stood against the world; now lies he there.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3132 -->
<LINE>And none so poor to do him reverence.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3133 -->
<LINE>O masters, if I were disposed to stir</LINE>
<!-- Node #3134 -->
<LINE>Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3135 -->
<LINE>I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3136 -->
<LINE>Who, you all know, are honourable men:</LINE>
<!-- Node #3137 -->
<LINE>I will not do them wrong; I rather choose</LINE>
<!-- Node #3138 -->
<LINE>To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3139 -->
<LINE>Than I will wrong such honourable men.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3140 -->
<LINE>But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;</LINE>
<!-- Node #3141 -->
<LINE>I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:</LINE>
<!-- Node #3142 -->
<LINE>Let but the commons hear this testament--</LINE>
<!-- Node #3143 -->
<LINE>Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--</LINE>
<!-- Node #3144 -->
<LINE>And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds</LINE>
<!-- Node #3145 -->
<LINE>And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3146 -->
<LINE>Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3147 -->
<LINE>And, dying, mention it within their wills,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3148 -->
<LINE>Bequeathing it as a rich legacy</LINE>
<!-- Node #3149 -->
<LINE>Unto their issue.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3150 -->
<SPEAKER>Fourth Citizen</SPEAKER>

<LINE>We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.</LINE>

<LINE>Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;</LINE>
<!-- Node #3156 -->
<LINE>It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3157 -->
<LINE>You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;</LINE>
<!-- Node #3158 -->
<LINE>And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3159 -->
<LINE>It will inflame you, it will make you mad:</LINE>
<!-- Node #3160 -->
<LINE>'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;</LINE>

<LINE>You all do know this mantle: I remember</LINE>
<!-- Node #3201 -->
<LINE>The first time ever Caesar put it on;</LINE>
<!-- Node #3202 -->
<LINE>'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3203 -->
<LINE>That day he overcame the Nervii:</LINE>
<!-- Node #3204 -->
<LINE>Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:</LINE>
<!-- Node #3205 -->
<LINE>See what a rent the envious Casca made:</LINE>
<!-- Node #3206 -->
<LINE>Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;</LINE>
<!-- Node #3207 -->
<LINE>And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3208 -->
<LINE>Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3209 -->
<LINE>As rushing out of doors, to be resolved</LINE>
<!-- Node #3210 -->
<LINE>If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;</LINE>
<!-- Node #3211 -->
<LINE>For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:</LINE>
<!-- Node #3212 -->
<LINE>Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!</LINE>
<!-- Node #3213 -->
<LINE>This was the most unkindest cut of all;</LINE>
<!-- Node #3214 -->
<LINE>For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3215 -->
<LINE>Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3216 -->
<LINE>Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;</LINE>
<!-- Node #3217 -->
<LINE>And, in his mantle muffling up his face,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3218 -->
<LINE>Even at the base of Pompey's statua,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3219 -->
<LINE>Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3220 -->
<LINE>O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!</LINE>
<!-- Node #3221 -->
<LINE>Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3222 -->
<LINE>Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3223 -->
<LINE>O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel</LINE>

<!-- Node #3433 -->
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #3434 -->
<LINE>So you thought him;</LINE>

<LINE>In our black sentence and proscription.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3437 -->
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #3438 -->
<LINE>Octavius, I have seen more days than you:</LINE>

<LINE>To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3441 -->
<LINE>He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,</LINE>

<LINE>To groan and sweat under the business,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3443 -->
<LINE>Either led or driven, as we point the way;</LINE>
<!-- Node #3444 -->
<LINE>And having brought our treasure where we will,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3445 -->
<LINE>Then take we down his load, and turn him off,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3446 -->
<LINE>Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,</LINE>

<!-- Node #3448 -->
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #3449 -->
<LINE>You may do your will;</LINE>

<LINE>But he's a tried and valiant soldier.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3451 -->
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #3452 -->
<LINE>So is my horse, Octavius; and for that</LINE>
<!-- Node #3453 -->
<LINE>I do appoint him store of provender:</LINE>
<!-- Node #3454 -->
<LINE>It is a creature that I teach to fight,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3455 -->
<LINE>To wind, to stop, to run directly on,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3456 -->
<LINE>His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3457 -->
<LINE>And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;</LINE>
<!-- Node #3458 -->
<LINE>He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;</LINE>
<!-- Node #3459 -->
<LINE>A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds</LINE>
<!-- Node #3460 -->
<LINE>On abjects, orts and imitations,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3461 -->
<LINE>Which, out of use and staled by other men,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3462 -->
<LINE>Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3463 -->
<LINE>But as a property. And now, Octavius,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3464 -->
<LINE>Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius</LINE>
<!-- Node #3465 -->
<LINE>Are levying powers: we must straight make head:</LINE>
<!-- Node #3466 -->
<LINE>Therefore let our alliance be combined,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3467 -->
<LINE>Our best friends made, our means stretch'd</LINE>
<!-- Node #3468 -->
<LINE>And let us presently go sit in council,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3469 -->
<LINE>How covert matters may be best disclosed,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3470 -->
<LINE>And open perils surest answered.</LINE>
<!-- Node #3471 -->
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #3472 -->
<LINE>Let us do so: for we are at the stake,</LINE>
<!-- Node #3473 -->
<LINE>And bay'd about with many enemies;</LINE>

<LINE>You said the enemy would not come down,</LINE>

<LINE>But keep the hills and upper regions;</LINE>
<!-- Node #4086 -->
<LINE>It proves not so: their battles are at hand;</LINE>
<!-- Node #4087 -->
<LINE>They mean to warn us at Philippi here,</LINE>

<LINE>Answering before we do demand of them.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #4090 -->
<LINE>Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know</LINE>
<!-- Node #4091 -->
<LINE>Wherefore they do it: they could be content</LINE>
<!-- Node #4092 -->
<LINE>To visit other places; and come down</LINE>
<!-- Node #4093 -->
<LINE>With fearful bravery, thinking by this face</LINE>
<!-- Node #4094 -->
<LINE>To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;</LINE>
<!-- Node #4095 -->
<LINE>But 'tis not so.</LINE>

<LINE>Not that we love words better, as you do.</LINE>

<LINE>Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.</LINE>
<!-- Node #4130 -->
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>

<LINE>In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:</LINE>
<!-- Node #4132 -->

<!-- Node #4135 -->
<LINE>Antony,</LINE>

<LINE>The posture of your blows are yet unknown;</LINE>

<LINE>And leave them honeyless.</LINE>
<!-- Node #4139 -->
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #4140 -->
<LINE>Not stingless too.</LINE>
<!-- Node #4141 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>

<LINE>O, yes, and soundless too;</LINE>
<!-- Node #4143 -->
<LINE>For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,</LINE>
<!-- Node #4144 -->
<LINE>And very wisely threat before you sting.</LINE>
<!-- Node #4145 -->
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #4146 -->
<LINE>Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers</LINE>
<!-- Node #4147 -->
<LINE>Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:</LINE>
<!-- Node #4148 -->
<LINE>You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,</LINE>
<!-- Node #4149 -->
<LINE>And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;</LINE>
<!-- Node #4150 -->
<LINE>Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind</LINE>
<!-- Node #4151 -->
<LINE>Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!</LINE>
<!-- Node #4152 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #4153 -->
<LINE>Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:</LINE>
<!-- Node #4154 -->
<LINE>This tongue had not offended so to-day,</LINE>
<!-- Node #4155 -->
<LINE>If Cassius might have ruled.</LINE>
<!-- Node #4156 -->
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #4157 -->
<LINE>Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,</LINE>
<!-- Node #4158 -->
<LINE>The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;</LINE>
<!-- Node #4159 -->
<LINE>I draw a sword against conspirators;</LINE>
<!-- Node #4160 -->
<LINE>When think you that the sword goes up again?</LINE>
<!-- Node #4161 -->
<LINE>Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds</LINE>
<!-- Node #4162 -->
<LINE>Be well avenged; or till another Caesar</LINE>
<!-- Node #4163 -->
<LINE>Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.</LINE>
<!-- Node #4164 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #4165 -->

<!-- Node #4166 -->
<LINE>Unless thou bring'st them with thee.</LINE>
<!-- Node #4167 -->
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #4168 -->
<LINE>So I hope;</LINE>

  <STAGEDIR>Standing forth</STAGEDIR>  What says my general?</LINE>
<!-- Node #4196 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #4197 -->
<LINE>Messala,</LINE>
<!-- Node #4198 -->
<LINE>This is my birth-day; as this very day</LINE>
<!-- Node #4199 -->
<LINE>Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:</LINE>
<!-- Node #4200 -->
<LINE>Be thou my witness that against my will,</LINE>
<!-- Node #4201 -->
<LINE>As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set</LINE>
<!-- Node #4202 -->
<LINE>Upon one battle all our liberties.</LINE>
<!-- Node #4203 -->
<LINE>You know that I held Epicurus strong</LINE>
<!-- Node #4204 -->
<LINE>And his opinion: now I change my mind,</LINE>
<!-- Node #4205 -->
<LINE>And partly credit things that do presage.</LINE>
<!-- Node #4206 -->
<LINE>Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign</LINE>
<!-- Node #4207 -->
<LINE>Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,</LINE>
<!-- Node #4208 -->
<LINE>Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;</LINE>
<!-- Node #4209 -->
<LINE>Who to Philippi here consorted us:</LINE>
<!-- Node #4210 -->
<LINE>This morning are they fled away and gone;</LINE>
<!-- Node #4211 -->
<LINE>And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,</LINE>
<!-- Node #4212 -->
<LINE>Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,</LINE>
<!-- Node #4213 -->
<LINE>As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem</LINE>
<!-- Node #4214 -->
<LINE>A canopy most fatal, under which</LINE>
<!-- Node #4215 -->

<!-- Node #4217 -->
<LINE>Believe not so.</LINE>
<!-- Node #4218 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #4219 -->
<LINE>I but believe it partly;</LINE>
<!-- Node #4220 -->
<LINE>For I am fresh of spirit and resolved</LINE>
<!-- Node #4221 -->
<LINE>To meet all perils very constantly.</LINE>
<!-- Node #4222 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #4223 -->
<LINE>Even so, Lucilius.</LINE>
<!-- Node #4224 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #4225 -->
<LINE>Now, most noble Brutus,</LINE>
<!-- Node #4226 -->
<LINE>The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,</LINE>
<!-- Node #4227 -->
<LINE>Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!</LINE>
<!-- Node #4228 -->
<LINE>But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,</LINE>
<!-- Node #4229 -->
<LINE>Let's reason with the worst that may befall.</LINE>
<!-- Node #4230 -->
<LINE>If we do lose this battle, then is this</LINE>
<!-- Node #4231 -->
<LINE>The very last time we shall speak together:</LINE>
<!-- Node #4232 -->
<LINE>What are you then determined to do?</LINE>
<!-- Node #4233 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #4234 -->
<LINE>Even by the rule of that philosophy</LINE>
<!-- Node #4235 -->
<LINE>By which I did blame Cato for the death</LINE>
<!-- Node #4236 -->
<LINE>Which he did give himself, I know not how,</LINE>
<!-- Node #4237 -->
<LINE>But I do find it cowardly and vile,</LINE>
<!-- Node #4238 -->
<LINE>For fear of what might fall, so to prevent</LINE>
<!-- Node #4239 -->
<LINE>The time of life: arming myself with patience</LINE>
<!-- Node #4240 -->
<LINE>To stay the providence of some high powers</LINE>
<!-- Node #4241 -->
<LINE>That govern us below.</LINE>
<!-- Node #4242 -->
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #4243 -->
<LINE>Then, if we lose this battle,</LINE>
<!-- Node #4244 -->
<LINE>You are contented to be led in triumph</LINE>
<!-- Node #4245 -->
<LINE>Thorough the streets of Rome?</LINE>
<!-- Node #4246 -->
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #4247 -->
<LINE>No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,</LINE>
<!-- Node #4248 -->
<LINE>That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;</LINE>
<!-- Node #4249 -->

<LINE>I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:</LINE>
<!-- Node #4574 -->
<LINE>Thou art a fellow of a good respect;</LINE>
<!-- Node #4575 -->
<LINE>Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:</LINE>
<!-- Node #4576 -->
<LINE>Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,</LINE>

<LINE>While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?</LINE>
<!-- Node #4578 -->
<SPEAKER>STRATO</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #4579 -->
<LINE>Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.</LINE>
<!-- Node #4580 -->

<!-- Node #4587 -->
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #4588 -->
<LINE>What man is that?</LINE>
<!-- Node #4589 -->
<SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #4590 -->
<LINE>My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?</LINE>
<!-- Node #4591 -->
<SPEAKER>STRATO</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #4592 -->
<LINE>Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:</LINE>
<!-- Node #4593 -->
<LINE>The conquerors can but make a fire of him;</LINE>
<!-- Node #4594 -->
<LINE>For Brutus only overcame himself,</LINE>
<!-- Node #4595 -->
<LINE>And no man else hath honour by his death.</LINE>
<!-- Node #4596 -->
<SPEAKER>LUCILIUS</SPEAKER>
<!-- Node #4597 -->
<LINE>So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,</LINE>

<!-- Node #4617 -->
<LINE>He only, in a general honest thought</LINE>
<!-- Node #4618 -->
<LINE>And common good to all, made one of them.</LINE>
<!-- Node #4619 -->
<LINE>His life was gentle, and the elements</LINE>

<!-- Node #4629 -->
Exeunt
<!-- Node #4630 -->
FLAVIUS
<!-- Node #4631 -->
Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:
<!-- Node #4632 -->
Is this a holiday? what! know you not,
<!-- Node #4633 -->
Being mechanical, you ought not walk
<!-- Node #4634 -->
Upon a labouring day without the sign
<!-- Node #4635 -->
Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?
<!-- Node #4636 -->
First Commoner
<!-- Node #4637 -->
Why, sir, a carpenter.
<!-- Node #4638 -->
MARULLUS
<!-- Node #4639 -->
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
<!-- Node #4640 -->
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
<!-- Node #4641 -->
You, sir, what trade are you?
<!-- Node #4642 -->
Second Commoner
<!-- Node #4643 -->
Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,
<!-- Node #4644 -->
as you would say, a cobbler.
<!-- Node #4645 -->
MARULLUS
<!-- Node #4646 -->
But what trade art thou? answer me directly.
<!-- Node #4647 -->
Second Commoner
<!-- Node #4648 -->
A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe
<!-- Node #4649 -->
conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.
<!-- Node #4650 -->
MARULLUS
<!-- Node #4651 -->
What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?
<!-- Node #4652 -->
Second Commoner
<!-- Node #4653 -->
Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,
<!-- Node #4654 -->
if you be out, sir, I can mend you.
<!-- Node #4655 -->
MARULLUS
<!-- Node #4656 -->
What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!
<!-- Node #4657 -->
Second Commoner
<!-- Node #4658 -->
Why, sir, cobble you.
<!-- Node #4659 -->
FLAVIUS
<!-- Node #4660 -->
Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
<!-- Node #4661 -->
Second Commoner
<!-- Node #4662 -->
Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I
<!-- Node #4663 -->
meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's
<!-- Node #4664 -->
matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon
<!-- Node #4665 -->
to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I
<!-- Node #4666 -->
recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
<!-- Node #4667 -->
neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.
<!-- Node #4668 -->
FLAVIUS
<!-- Node #4669 -->
But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
<!-- Node #4670 -->
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
<!-- Node #4671 -->
Second Commoner
<!-- Node #4672 -->
Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself
<!-- Node #4673 -->
into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,
<!-- Node #4674 -->
to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.
<!-- Node #4675 -->
MARULLUS
<!-- Node #4676 -->
Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
<!-- Node #4677 -->
What tributaries follow him to Rome,
<!-- Node #4678 -->
To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?
<!-- Node #4679 -->
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
<!-- Node #4680 -->
O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
<!-- Node #4681 -->
Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
<!-- Node #4682 -->
Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,
<!-- Node #4683 -->
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,
<!-- Node #4684 -->
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
<!-- Node #4685 -->
The livelong day, with patient expectation,
<!-- Node #4686 -->
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:
<!-- Node #4687 -->
And when you saw his chariot but appear,
<!-- Node #4688 -->
Have you not made an universal shout,
<!-- Node #4689 -->
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
<!-- Node #4690 -->
To hear the replication of your sounds
<!-- Node #4691 -->
Made in her concave shores?
<!-- Node #4692 -->
And do you now put on your best attire?
<!-- Node #4693 -->
And do you now cull out a holiday?
<!-- Node #4694 -->
And do you now strew flowers in his way
<!-- Node #4695 -->
That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!
<!-- Node #4696 -->
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
<!-- Node #4697 -->
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
<!-- Node #4698 -->
That needs must light on this ingratitude.
<!-- Node #4699 -->
FLAVIUS
<!-- Node #4700 -->
Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
<!-- Node #4701 -->
Assemble all the poor men of your sort;
<!-- Node #4702 -->
Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
<!-- Node #4703 -->
Into the channel, till the lowest stream
<!-- Node #4704 -->
Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
<!-- Node #4705 -->
Exeunt all the Commoners
<!-- Node #4706 -->
See whether their basest metal be not moved;
<!-- Node #4707 -->
They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
<!-- Node #4708 -->
Go you down that way towards the Capitol;
<!-- Node #4709 -->
This way will I disrobe the images,
<!-- Node #4710 -->
If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.
<!-- Node #4711 -->
MARULLUS
<!-- Node #4712 -->
May we do so?
<!-- Node #4713 -->
You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
<!-- Node #4714 -->
FLAVIUS
<!-- Node #4715 -->
It is no matter; let no images
<!-- Node #4716 -->
Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,
<!-- Node #4717 -->
And drive away the vulgar from the streets:
<!-- Node #4718 -->
So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
<!-- Node #4719 -->
These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing
<!-- Node #4720 -->
Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
<!-- Node #4721 -->
Who else would soar above the view of men
<!-- Node #4722 -->
And keep us all in servile fearfulness.
<!-- Node #4723 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #4724 -->
Calpurnia!
<!-- Node #4725 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #4726 -->
Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.
<!-- Node #4727 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #4728 -->
Calpurnia!
<!-- Node #4729 -->
CALPURNIA
<!-- Node #4730 -->
Here, my lord.
<!-- Node #4731 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #4732 -->
Stand you directly in Antonius' way,
<!-- Node #4733 -->
When he doth run his course. Antonius!
<!-- Node #4734 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #4735 -->
Caesar, my lord?
<!-- Node #4736 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #4737 -->
Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,
<!-- Node #4738 -->
To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,
<!-- Node #4739 -->
The barren, touched in this holy chase,
<!-- Node #4740 -->
Shake off their sterile curse.
<!-- Node #4741 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #4742 -->
I shall remember:
<!-- Node #4743 -->
When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.
<!-- Node #4744 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #4745 -->
Set on; and leave no ceremony out.
<!-- Node #4746 -->
Soothsayer
<!-- Node #4747 -->
Caesar!
<!-- Node #4748 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #4749 -->
Ha! who calls?
<!-- Node #4750 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #4751 -->
Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!
<!-- Node #4752 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #4753 -->
Who is it in the press that calls on me?
<!-- Node #4754 -->
I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,
<!-- Node #4755 -->
Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.
<!-- Node #4756 -->
Soothsayer
<!-- Node #4757 -->
Beware the ides of March.
<!-- Node #4758 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #4759 -->
What man is that?
<!-- Node #4760 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #4761 -->
A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.
<!-- Node #4762 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #4763 -->
Set him before me; let me see his face.
<!-- Node #4764 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #4765 -->
Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.
<!-- Node #4766 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #4767 -->
What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.
<!-- Node #4768 -->
Soothsayer
<!-- Node #4769 -->
Beware the ides of March.
<!-- Node #4770 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #4771 -->
He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.
<!-- Node #4772 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #4773 -->
Will you go see the order of the course?
<!-- Node #4774 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #4775 -->
Not I.
<!-- Node #4776 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #4777 -->
I pray you, do.
<!-- Node #4778 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #4779 -->
I am not gamesome: I do lack some part
<!-- Node #4780 -->
Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
<!-- Node #4781 -->
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;
<!-- Node #4782 -->
I'll leave you.
<!-- Node #4783 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #4784 -->
Brutus, I do observe you now of late:
<!-- Node #4785 -->
I have not from your eyes that gentleness
<!-- Node #4786 -->
And show of love as I was wont to have:
<!-- Node #4787 -->
You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
<!-- Node #4788 -->
Over your friend that loves you.
<!-- Node #4789 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #4790 -->
Cassius,
<!-- Node #4791 -->
Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,
<!-- Node #4792 -->
I turn the trouble of my countenance
<!-- Node #4793 -->
Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
<!-- Node #4794 -->
Of late with passions of some difference,
<!-- Node #4795 -->
Conceptions only proper to myself,
<!-- Node #4796 -->
Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
<!-- Node #4797 -->
But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--
<!-- Node #4798 -->
Among which number, Cassius, be you one--
<!-- Node #4799 -->
Nor construe any further my neglect,
<!-- Node #4800 -->
Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
<!-- Node #4801 -->
Forgets the shows of love to other men.
<!-- Node #4802 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #4803 -->
Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;
<!-- Node #4804 -->
By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
<!-- Node #4805 -->
Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
<!-- Node #4806 -->
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
<!-- Node #4807 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #4808 -->
No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,
<!-- Node #4809 -->
But by reflection, by some other things.
<!-- Node #4810 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #4811 -->
'Tis just:
<!-- Node #4812 -->
And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
<!-- Node #4813 -->
That you have no such mirrors as will turn
<!-- Node #4814 -->
Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
<!-- Node #4815 -->
That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
<!-- Node #4816 -->
Where many of the best respect in Rome,
<!-- Node #4817 -->
Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus
<!-- Node #4818 -->
And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
<!-- Node #4819 -->
Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.
<!-- Node #4820 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #4821 -->
Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
<!-- Node #4822 -->
That you would have me seek into myself
<!-- Node #4823 -->
For that which is not in me?
<!-- Node #4824 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #4825 -->
Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:
<!-- Node #4826 -->
And since you know you cannot see yourself
<!-- Node #4827 -->
So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
<!-- Node #4828 -->
Will modestly discover to yourself
<!-- Node #4829 -->
That of yourself which you yet know not of.
<!-- Node #4830 -->
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:
<!-- Node #4831 -->
Were I a common laugher, or did use
<!-- Node #4832 -->
To stale with ordinary oaths my love
<!-- Node #4833 -->
To every new protester; if you know
<!-- Node #4834 -->
That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
<!-- Node #4835 -->
And after scandal them, or if you know
<!-- Node #4836 -->
That I profess myself in banqueting
<!-- Node #4837 -->
To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
<!-- Node #4838 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #4839 -->
What means this shouting? I do fear, the people
<!-- Node #4840 -->
Choose Caesar for their king.
<!-- Node #4841 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #4842 -->
Ay, do you fear it?
<!-- Node #4843 -->
Then must I think you would not have it so.
<!-- Node #4844 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #4845 -->
I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.
<!-- Node #4846 -->
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
<!-- Node #4847 -->
What is it that you would impart to me?
<!-- Node #4848 -->
If it be aught toward the general good,
<!-- Node #4849 -->
Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,
<!-- Node #4850 -->
And I will look on both indifferently,
<!-- Node #4851 -->
For let the gods so speed me as I love
<!-- Node #4852 -->
The name of honour more than I fear death.
<!-- Node #4853 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #4854 -->
I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
<!-- Node #4855 -->
As well as I do know your outward favour.
<!-- Node #4856 -->
Well, honour is the subject of my story.
<!-- Node #4857 -->
I cannot tell what you and other men
<!-- Node #4858 -->
Think of this life; but, for my single self,
<!-- Node #4859 -->
I had as lief not be as live to be
<!-- Node #4860 -->
In awe of such a thing as I myself.
<!-- Node #4861 -->
I was born free as Caesar; so were you:
<!-- Node #4862 -->
We both have fed as well, and we can both
<!-- Node #4863 -->
Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
<!-- Node #4864 -->
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
<!-- Node #4865 -->
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
<!-- Node #4866 -->
Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now
<!-- Node #4867 -->
Leap in with me into this angry flood,
<!-- Node #4868 -->
And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,
<!-- Node #4869 -->
Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
<!-- Node #4870 -->
And bade him follow; so indeed he did.
<!-- Node #4871 -->
The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
<!-- Node #4872 -->
With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
<!-- Node #4873 -->
And stemming it with hearts of controversy;
<!-- Node #4874 -->
But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
<!-- Node #4875 -->
Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'
<!-- Node #4876 -->
I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,
<!-- Node #4877 -->
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
<!-- Node #4878 -->
The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
<!-- Node #4879 -->
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
<!-- Node #4880 -->
Is now become a god, and Cassius is
<!-- Node #4881 -->
A wretched creature and must bend his body,
<!-- Node #4882 -->
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
<!-- Node #4883 -->
He had a fever when he was in Spain,
<!-- Node #4884 -->
And when the fit was on him, I did mark
<!-- Node #4885 -->
How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;
<!-- Node #4886 -->
His coward lips did from their colour fly,
<!-- Node #4887 -->
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
<!-- Node #4888 -->
Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
<!-- Node #4889 -->
Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
<!-- Node #4890 -->
Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
<!-- Node #4891 -->
Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'
<!-- Node #4892 -->
As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me
<!-- Node #4893 -->
A man of such a feeble temper should
<!-- Node #4894 -->
So get the start of the majestic world
<!-- Node #4895 -->
And bear the palm alone.
<!-- Node #4896 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #4897 -->
Another general shout!
<!-- Node #4898 -->
I do believe that these applauses are
<!-- Node #4899 -->
For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.
<!-- Node #4900 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #4901 -->
Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
<!-- Node #4902 -->
Like a Colossus, and we petty men
<!-- Node #4903 -->
Walk under his huge legs and peep about
<!-- Node #4904 -->
To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
<!-- Node #4905 -->
Men at some time are masters of their fates:
<!-- Node #4906 -->
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
<!-- Node #4907 -->
But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
<!-- Node #4908 -->
Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?
<!-- Node #4909 -->
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
<!-- Node #4910 -->
Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
<!-- Node #4911 -->
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
<!-- Node #4912 -->
Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,
<!-- Node #4913 -->
Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.
<!-- Node #4914 -->
Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
<!-- Node #4915 -->
Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,
<!-- Node #4916 -->
That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
<!-- Node #4917 -->
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
<!-- Node #4918 -->
When went there by an age, since the great flood,
<!-- Node #4919 -->
But it was famed with more than with one man?
<!-- Node #4920 -->
When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,
<!-- Node #4921 -->
That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
<!-- Node #4922 -->
Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,
<!-- Node #4923 -->
When there is in it but one only man.
<!-- Node #4924 -->
O, you and I have heard our fathers say,
<!-- Node #4925 -->
There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
<!-- Node #4926 -->
The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
<!-- Node #4927 -->
As easily as a king.
<!-- Node #4928 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #4929 -->
That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
<!-- Node #4930 -->
What you would work me to, I have some aim:
<!-- Node #4931 -->
How I have thought of this and of these times,
<!-- Node #4932 -->
I shall recount hereafter; for this present,
<!-- Node #4933 -->
I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
<!-- Node #4934 -->
Be any further moved. What you have said
<!-- Node #4935 -->
I will consider; what you have to say
<!-- Node #4936 -->
I will with patience hear, and find a time
<!-- Node #4937 -->
Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
<!-- Node #4938 -->
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
<!-- Node #4939 -->
Brutus had rather be a villager
<!-- Node #4940 -->
Than to repute himself a son of Rome
<!-- Node #4941 -->
Under these hard conditions as this time
<!-- Node #4942 -->
Is like to lay upon us.
<!-- Node #4943 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #4944 -->
I am glad that my weak words
<!-- Node #4945 -->
Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
<!-- Node #4946 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #4947 -->
The games are done and Caesar is returning.
<!-- Node #4948 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #4949 -->
As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;
<!-- Node #4950 -->
And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
<!-- Node #4951 -->
What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.
<!-- Node #4952 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #4953 -->
I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
<!-- Node #4954 -->
The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,
<!-- Node #4955 -->
And all the rest look like a chidden train:
<!-- Node #4956 -->
Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero
<!-- Node #4957 -->
Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
<!-- Node #4958 -->
As we have seen him in the Capitol,
<!-- Node #4959 -->
Being cross'd in conference by some senators.
<!-- Node #4960 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #4961 -->
Casca will tell us what the matter is.
<!-- Node #4962 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #4963 -->
Antonius!
<!-- Node #4964 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #4965 -->
Caesar?
<!-- Node #4966 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #4967 -->
Let me have men about me that are fat;
<!-- Node #4968 -->
Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:
<!-- Node #4969 -->
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
<!-- Node #4970 -->
He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.
<!-- Node #4971 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #4972 -->
Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
<!-- Node #4973 -->
He is a noble Roman and well given.
<!-- Node #4974 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #4975 -->
Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:
<!-- Node #4976 -->
Yet if my name were liable to fear,
<!-- Node #4977 -->
I do not know the man I should avoid
<!-- Node #4978 -->
So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
<!-- Node #4979 -->
He is a great observer and he looks
<!-- Node #4980 -->
Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
<!-- Node #4981 -->
As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
<!-- Node #4982 -->
Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
<!-- Node #4983 -->
As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
<!-- Node #4984 -->
That could be moved to smile at any thing.
<!-- Node #4985 -->
Such men as he be never at heart's ease
<!-- Node #4986 -->
Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
<!-- Node #4987 -->
And therefore are they very dangerous.
<!-- Node #4988 -->
I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
<!-- Node #4989 -->
Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.
<!-- Node #4990 -->
Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
<!-- Node #4991 -->
And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.
<!-- Node #4992 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #4993 -->
You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
<!-- Node #4994 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #4995 -->
Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,
<!-- Node #4996 -->
That Caesar looks so sad.
<!-- Node #4997 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #4998 -->
Why, you were with him, were you not?
<!-- Node #4999 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5000 -->
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
<!-- Node #5001 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5002 -->
Why, there was a crown offered him: and being
<!-- Node #5003 -->
offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,
<!-- Node #5004 -->
thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.
<!-- Node #5005 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5006 -->
What was the second noise for?
<!-- Node #5007 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5008 -->
Why, for that too.
<!-- Node #5009 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5010 -->
They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?
<!-- Node #5011 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5012 -->
Why, for that too.
<!-- Node #5013 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5014 -->
Was the crown offered him thrice?
<!-- Node #5015 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5016 -->
Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every
<!-- Node #5017 -->
time gentler than other, and at every putting-by
<!-- Node #5018 -->
mine honest neighbours shouted.
<!-- Node #5019 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5020 -->
Who offered him the crown?
<!-- Node #5021 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5022 -->
Why, Antony.
<!-- Node #5023 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5024 -->
Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
<!-- Node #5025 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5026 -->
I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:
<!-- Node #5027 -->
it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark
<!-- Node #5028 -->
Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown
<!-- Node #5029 -->
neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told
<!-- Node #5030 -->
you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my
<!-- Node #5031 -->
thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he
<!-- Node #5032 -->
offered it to him again; then he put it by again:
<!-- Node #5033 -->
but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his
<!-- Node #5034 -->
fingers off it. And then he offered it the third
<!-- Node #5035 -->
time; he put it the third time by: and still as he
<!-- Node #5036 -->
refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their
<!-- Node #5037 -->
chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
<!-- Node #5038 -->
and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
<!-- Node #5039 -->
Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
<!-- Node #5040 -->
Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and
<!-- Node #5041 -->
for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of
<!-- Node #5042 -->
opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
<!-- Node #5043 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5044 -->
But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?
<!-- Node #5045 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5046 -->
He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at
<!-- Node #5047 -->
mouth, and was speechless.
<!-- Node #5048 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5049 -->
'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.
<!-- Node #5050 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5051 -->
No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,
<!-- Node #5052 -->
And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
<!-- Node #5053 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5054 -->
I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,
<!-- Node #5055 -->
Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not
<!-- Node #5056 -->
clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and
<!-- Node #5057 -->
displeased them, as they use to do the players in
<!-- Node #5058 -->
the theatre, I am no true man.
<!-- Node #5059 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5060 -->
What said he when he came unto himself?
<!-- Node #5061 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5062 -->
Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the
<!-- Node #5063 -->
common herd was glad he refused the crown, he
<!-- Node #5064 -->
plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
<!-- Node #5065 -->
throat to cut. An I had been a man of any
<!-- Node #5066 -->
occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,
<!-- Node #5067 -->
I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so
<!-- Node #5068 -->
he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,
<!-- Node #5069 -->
If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired
<!-- Node #5070 -->
their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three
<!-- Node #5071 -->
or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good
<!-- Node #5072 -->
soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but
<!-- Node #5073 -->
there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had
<!-- Node #5074 -->
stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.
<!-- Node #5075 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5076 -->
And after that, he came, thus sad, away?
<!-- Node #5077 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5078 -->
Ay.
<!-- Node #5079 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5080 -->
Did Cicero say any thing?
<!-- Node #5081 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5082 -->
Ay, he spoke Greek.
<!-- Node #5083 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5084 -->
To what effect?
<!-- Node #5085 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5086 -->
Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the
<!-- Node #5087 -->
face again: but those that understood him smiled at
<!-- Node #5088 -->
one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own
<!-- Node #5089 -->
part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more
<!-- Node #5090 -->
news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs
<!-- Node #5091 -->
off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you
<!-- Node #5092 -->
well. There was more foolery yet, if I could
<!-- Node #5093 -->
remember it.
<!-- Node #5094 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5095 -->
Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?
<!-- Node #5096 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5097 -->
No, I am promised forth.
<!-- Node #5098 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5099 -->
Will you dine with me to-morrow?
<!-- Node #5100 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5101 -->
Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
<!-- Node #5102 -->
worth the eating.
<!-- Node #5103 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5104 -->
Good: I will expect you.
<!-- Node #5105 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5106 -->
Do so. Farewell, both.
<!-- Node #5107 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5108 -->
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
<!-- Node #5109 -->
He was quick mettle when he went to school.
<!-- Node #5110 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5111 -->
So is he now in execution
<!-- Node #5112 -->
Of any bold or noble enterprise,
<!-- Node #5113 -->
However he puts on this tardy form.
<!-- Node #5114 -->
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
<!-- Node #5115 -->
Which gives men stomach to digest his words
<!-- Node #5116 -->
With better appetite.
<!-- Node #5117 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5118 -->
And so it is. For this time I will leave you:
<!-- Node #5119 -->
To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,
<!-- Node #5120 -->
I will come home to you; or, if you will,
<!-- Node #5121 -->
Come home to me, and I will wait for you.
<!-- Node #5122 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5123 -->
I will do so: till then, think of the world.
<!-- Node #5124 -->
Exit BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5125 -->
Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,
<!-- Node #5126 -->
Thy honourable metal may be wrought
<!-- Node #5127 -->
From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet
<!-- Node #5128 -->
That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
<!-- Node #5129 -->
For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
<!-- Node #5130 -->
Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:
<!-- Node #5131 -->
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,
<!-- Node #5132 -->
He should not humour me. I will this night,
<!-- Node #5133 -->
In several hands, in at his windows throw,
<!-- Node #5134 -->
As if they came from several citizens,
<!-- Node #5135 -->
Writings all tending to the great opinion
<!-- Node #5136 -->
That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely
<!-- Node #5137 -->
Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:
<!-- Node #5138 -->
And after this let Caesar seat him sure;
<!-- Node #5139 -->
For we will shake him, or worse days endure.
<!-- Node #5140 -->
CICERO
<!-- Node #5141 -->
Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?
<!-- Node #5142 -->
Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?
<!-- Node #5143 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5144 -->
Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
<!-- Node #5145 -->
Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
<!-- Node #5146 -->
I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds
<!-- Node #5147 -->
Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
<!-- Node #5148 -->
The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,
<!-- Node #5149 -->
To be exalted with the threatening clouds:
<!-- Node #5150 -->
But never till to-night, never till now,
<!-- Node #5151 -->
Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
<!-- Node #5152 -->
Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
<!-- Node #5153 -->
Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
<!-- Node #5154 -->
Incenses them to send destruction.
<!-- Node #5155 -->
CICERO
<!-- Node #5156 -->
Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?
<!-- Node #5157 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5158 -->
A common slave--you know him well by sight--
<!-- Node #5159 -->
Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
<!-- Node #5160 -->
Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,
<!-- Node #5161 -->
Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.
<!-- Node #5162 -->
Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--
<!-- Node #5163 -->
Against the Capitol I met a lion,
<!-- Node #5164 -->
Who glared upon me, and went surly by,
<!-- Node #5165 -->
Without annoying me: and there were drawn
<!-- Node #5166 -->
Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,
<!-- Node #5167 -->
Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw
<!-- Node #5168 -->
Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
<!-- Node #5169 -->
And yesterday the bird of night did sit
<!-- Node #5170 -->
Even at noon-day upon the market-place,
<!-- Node #5171 -->
Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies
<!-- Node #5172 -->
Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
<!-- Node #5173 -->
'These are their reasons; they are natural;'
<!-- Node #5174 -->
For, I believe, they are portentous things
<!-- Node #5175 -->
Unto the climate that they point upon.
<!-- Node #5176 -->
CICERO
<!-- Node #5177 -->
Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:
<!-- Node #5178 -->
But men may construe things after their fashion,
<!-- Node #5179 -->
Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
<!-- Node #5180 -->
Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?
<!-- Node #5181 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5182 -->
He doth; for he did bid Antonius
<!-- Node #5183 -->
Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.
<!-- Node #5184 -->
CICERO
<!-- Node #5185 -->
Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky
<!-- Node #5186 -->
Is not to walk in.
<!-- Node #5187 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5188 -->
Farewell, Cicero.
<!-- Node #5189 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5190 -->
Who's there?
<!-- Node #5191 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5192 -->
A Roman.
<!-- Node #5193 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5194 -->
Casca, by your voice.
<!-- Node #5195 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5196 -->
Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
<!-- Node #5197 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5198 -->
A very pleasing night to honest men.
<!-- Node #5199 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5200 -->
Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
<!-- Node #5201 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5202 -->
Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
<!-- Node #5203 -->
For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,
<!-- Node #5204 -->
Submitting me unto the perilous night,
<!-- Node #5205 -->
And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
<!-- Node #5206 -->
Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;
<!-- Node #5207 -->
And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
<!-- Node #5208 -->
The breast of heaven, I did present myself
<!-- Node #5209 -->
Even in the aim and very flash of it.
<!-- Node #5210 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5211 -->
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
<!-- Node #5212 -->
It is the part of men to fear and tremble,
<!-- Node #5213 -->
When the most mighty gods by tokens send
<!-- Node #5214 -->
Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
<!-- Node #5215 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5216 -->
You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
<!-- Node #5217 -->
That should be in a Roman you do want,
<!-- Node #5218 -->
Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze
<!-- Node #5219 -->
And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,
<!-- Node #5220 -->
To see the strange impatience of the heavens:
<!-- Node #5221 -->
But if you would consider the true cause
<!-- Node #5222 -->
Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
<!-- Node #5223 -->
Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
<!-- Node #5224 -->
Why old men fool and children calculate,
<!-- Node #5225 -->
Why all these things change from their ordinance
<!-- Node #5226 -->
Their natures and preformed faculties
<!-- Node #5227 -->
To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find
<!-- Node #5228 -->
That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,
<!-- Node #5229 -->
To make them instruments of fear and warning
<!-- Node #5230 -->
Unto some monstrous state.
<!-- Node #5231 -->
Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
<!-- Node #5232 -->
Most like this dreadful night,
<!-- Node #5233 -->
That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
<!-- Node #5234 -->
As doth the lion in the Capitol,
<!-- Node #5235 -->
A man no mightier than thyself or me
<!-- Node #5236 -->
In personal action, yet prodigious grown
<!-- Node #5237 -->
And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.
<!-- Node #5238 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5239 -->
'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?
<!-- Node #5240 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5241 -->
Let it be who it is: for Romans now
<!-- Node #5242 -->
Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;
<!-- Node #5243 -->
But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,
<!-- Node #5244 -->
And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;
<!-- Node #5245 -->
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
<!-- Node #5246 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5247 -->
Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow
<!-- Node #5248 -->
Mean to establish Caesar as a king;
<!-- Node #5249 -->
And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,
<!-- Node #5250 -->
In every place, save here in Italy.
<!-- Node #5251 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5252 -->
I know where I will wear this dagger then;
<!-- Node #5253 -->
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:
<!-- Node #5254 -->
Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
<!-- Node #5255 -->
Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:
<!-- Node #5256 -->
Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
<!-- Node #5257 -->
Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,
<!-- Node #5258 -->
Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
<!-- Node #5259 -->
But life, being weary of these worldly bars,
<!-- Node #5260 -->
Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
<!-- Node #5261 -->
If I know this, know all the world besides,
<!-- Node #5262 -->
That part of tyranny that I do bear
<!-- Node #5263 -->
I can shake off at pleasure.
<!-- Node #5264 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5265 -->
So can I:
<!-- Node #5266 -->
So every bondman in his own hand bears
<!-- Node #5267 -->
The power to cancel his captivity.
<!-- Node #5268 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5269 -->
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
<!-- Node #5270 -->
Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,
<!-- Node #5271 -->
But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:
<!-- Node #5272 -->
He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
<!-- Node #5273 -->
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
<!-- Node #5274 -->
Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,
<!-- Node #5275 -->
What rubbish and what offal, when it serves
<!-- Node #5276 -->
For the base matter to illuminate
<!-- Node #5277 -->
So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,
<!-- Node #5278 -->
Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
<!-- Node #5279 -->
Before a willing bondman; then I know
<!-- Node #5280 -->
My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,
<!-- Node #5281 -->
And dangers are to me indifferent.
<!-- Node #5282 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5283 -->
You speak to Casca, and to such a man
<!-- Node #5284 -->
That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:
<!-- Node #5285 -->
Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
<!-- Node #5286 -->
And I will set this foot of mine as far
<!-- Node #5287 -->
As who goes farthest.
<!-- Node #5288 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5289 -->
There's a bargain made.
<!-- Node #5290 -->
Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
<!-- Node #5291 -->
Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
<!-- Node #5292 -->
To undergo with me an enterprise
<!-- Node #5293 -->
Of honourable-dangerous consequence;
<!-- Node #5294 -->
And I do know, by this, they stay for me
<!-- Node #5295 -->
In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,
<!-- Node #5296 -->
There is no stir or walking in the streets;
<!-- Node #5297 -->
And the complexion of the element
<!-- Node #5298 -->
In favour's like the work we have in hand,
<!-- Node #5299 -->
Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
<!-- Node #5300 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5301 -->
Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
<!-- Node #5302 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5303 -->
'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;
<!-- Node #5304 -->
He is a friend.
<!-- Node #5305 -->
Enter CINNA
<!-- Node #5306 -->
Cinna, where haste you so?
<!-- Node #5307 -->
CINNA
<!-- Node #5308 -->
To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
<!-- Node #5309 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5310 -->
No, it is Casca; one incorporate
<!-- Node #5311 -->
To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?
<!-- Node #5312 -->
CINNA
<!-- Node #5313 -->
I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!
<!-- Node #5314 -->
There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.
<!-- Node #5315 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5316 -->
Am I not stay'd for? tell me.
<!-- Node #5317 -->
CINNA
<!-- Node #5318 -->
Yes, you are.
<!-- Node #5319 -->
O Cassius, if you could
<!-- Node #5320 -->
But win the noble Brutus to our party--
<!-- Node #5321 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5322 -->
Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,
<!-- Node #5323 -->
And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,
<!-- Node #5324 -->
Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
<!-- Node #5325 -->
In at his window; set this up with wax
<!-- Node #5326 -->
Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,
<!-- Node #5327 -->
Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.
<!-- Node #5328 -->
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
<!-- Node #5329 -->
CINNA
<!-- Node #5330 -->
All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone
<!-- Node #5331 -->
To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,
<!-- Node #5332 -->
And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
<!-- Node #5333 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5334 -->
That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.
<!-- Node #5335 -->
Exit CINNA
<!-- Node #5336 -->
Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day
<!-- Node #5337 -->
See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
<!-- Node #5338 -->
Is ours already, and the man entire
<!-- Node #5339 -->
Upon the next encounter yields him ours.
<!-- Node #5340 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5341 -->
O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:
<!-- Node #5342 -->
And that which would appear offence in us,
<!-- Node #5343 -->
His countenance, like richest alchemy,
<!-- Node #5344 -->
Will change to virtue and to worthiness.
<!-- Node #5345 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5346 -->
Him and his worth and our great need of him
<!-- Node #5347 -->
You have right well conceited. Let us go,
<!-- Node #5348 -->
For it is after midnight; and ere day
<!-- Node #5349 -->
We will awake him and be sure of him.
<!-- Node #5350 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5351 -->
What, Lucius, ho!
<!-- Node #5352 -->
I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
<!-- Node #5353 -->
Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
<!-- Node #5354 -->
I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
<!-- Node #5355 -->
When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!
<!-- Node #5356 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #5357 -->
Call'd you, my lord?
<!-- Node #5358 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5359 -->
Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:
<!-- Node #5360 -->
When it is lighted, come and call me here.
<!-- Node #5361 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #5362 -->
I will, my lord.
<!-- Node #5363 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5364 -->
It must be by his death: and for my part,
<!-- Node #5365 -->
I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
<!-- Node #5366 -->
But for the general. He would be crown'd:
<!-- Node #5367 -->
How that might change his nature, there's the question.
<!-- Node #5368 -->
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;
<!-- Node #5369 -->
And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--
<!-- Node #5370 -->
And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
<!-- Node #5371 -->
That at his will he may do danger with.
<!-- Node #5372 -->
The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins
<!-- Node #5373 -->
Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,
<!-- Node #5374 -->
I have not known when his affections sway'd
<!-- Node #5375 -->
More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,
<!-- Node #5376 -->
That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
<!-- Node #5377 -->
Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
<!-- Node #5378 -->
But when he once attains the upmost round.
<!-- Node #5379 -->
He then unto the ladder turns his back,
<!-- Node #5380 -->
Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
<!-- Node #5381 -->
By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.
<!-- Node #5382 -->
Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
<!-- Node #5383 -->
Will bear no colour for the thing he is,
<!-- Node #5384 -->
Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,
<!-- Node #5385 -->
Would run to these and these extremities:
<!-- Node #5386 -->
And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
<!-- Node #5387 -->
Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,
<!-- Node #5388 -->
And kill him in the shell.
<!-- Node #5389 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #5390 -->
The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
<!-- Node #5391 -->
Searching the window for a flint, I found
<!-- Node #5392 -->
This paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure,
<!-- Node #5393 -->
It did not lie there when I went to bed.
<!-- Node #5394 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5395 -->
Get you to bed again; it is not day.
<!-- Node #5396 -->
Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?
<!-- Node #5397 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #5398 -->
I know not, sir.
<!-- Node #5399 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5400 -->
Look in the calendar, and bring me word.
<!-- Node #5401 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #5402 -->
I will, sir.
<!-- Node #5403 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5404 -->
The exhalations whizzing in the air
<!-- Node #5405 -->
Give so much light that I may read by them.
<!-- Node #5406 -->
Opens the letter and reads
<!-- Node #5407 -->
'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself.
<!-- Node #5408 -->
Shall Rome, &amp;c. Speak, strike, redress!
<!-- Node #5409 -->
Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'
<!-- Node #5410 -->
Such instigations have been often dropp'd
<!-- Node #5411 -->
Where I have took them up.
<!-- Node #5412 -->
'Shall Rome, &amp;c.' Thus must I piece it out:
<!-- Node #5413 -->
Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
<!-- Node #5414 -->
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
<!-- Node #5415 -->
The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
<!-- Node #5416 -->
'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated
<!-- Node #5417 -->
To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:
<!-- Node #5418 -->
If the redress will follow, thou receivest
<!-- Node #5419 -->
Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
<!-- Node #5420 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #5421 -->
Sir, March is wasted fourteen days.
<!-- Node #5422 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5423 -->
'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.
<!-- Node #5424 -->
Exit LUCIUS
<!-- Node #5425 -->
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,
<!-- Node #5426 -->
I have not slept.
<!-- Node #5427 -->
Between the acting of a dreadful thing
<!-- Node #5428 -->
And the first motion, all the interim is
<!-- Node #5429 -->
Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:
<!-- Node #5430 -->
The Genius and the mortal instruments
<!-- Node #5431 -->
Are then in council; and the state of man,
<!-- Node #5432 -->
Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
<!-- Node #5433 -->
The nature of an insurrection.
<!-- Node #5434 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #5435 -->
Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
<!-- Node #5436 -->
Who doth desire to see you.
<!-- Node #5437 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5438 -->
Is he alone?
<!-- Node #5439 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #5440 -->
No, sir, there are moe with him.
<!-- Node #5441 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5442 -->
Do you know them?
<!-- Node #5443 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #5444 -->
No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
<!-- Node #5445 -->
And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
<!-- Node #5446 -->
That by no means I may discover them
<!-- Node #5447 -->
By any mark of favour.
<!-- Node #5448 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5449 -->
Let 'em enter.
<!-- Node #5450 -->
Exit LUCIUS
<!-- Node #5451 -->
They are the faction. O conspiracy,
<!-- Node #5452 -->
Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
<!-- Node #5453 -->
When evils are most free? O, then by day
<!-- Node #5454 -->
Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
<!-- Node #5455 -->
To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;
<!-- Node #5456 -->
Hide it in smiles and affability:
<!-- Node #5457 -->
For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
<!-- Node #5458 -->
Not Erebus itself were dim enough
<!-- Node #5459 -->
To hide thee from prevention.
<!-- Node #5460 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5461 -->
I think we are too bold upon your rest:
<!-- Node #5462 -->
Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?
<!-- Node #5463 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5464 -->
I have been up this hour, awake all night.
<!-- Node #5465 -->
Know I these men that come along with you?
<!-- Node #5466 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5467 -->
Yes, every man of them, and no man here
<!-- Node #5468 -->
But honours you; and every one doth wish
<!-- Node #5469 -->
You had but that opinion of yourself
<!-- Node #5470 -->
Which every noble Roman bears of you.
<!-- Node #5471 -->
This is Trebonius.
<!-- Node #5472 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5473 -->
He is welcome hither.
<!-- Node #5474 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5475 -->
This, Decius Brutus.
<!-- Node #5476 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5477 -->
He is welcome too.
<!-- Node #5478 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5479 -->
This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.
<!-- Node #5480 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5481 -->
They are all welcome.
<!-- Node #5482 -->
What watchful cares do interpose themselves
<!-- Node #5483 -->
Betwixt your eyes and night?
<!-- Node #5484 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5485 -->
Shall I entreat a word?
<!-- Node #5486 -->
DECIUS BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5487 -->
Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?
<!-- Node #5488 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5489 -->
No.
<!-- Node #5490 -->
CINNA
<!-- Node #5491 -->
O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
<!-- Node #5492 -->
That fret the clouds are messengers of day.
<!-- Node #5493 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5494 -->
You shall confess that you are both deceived.
<!-- Node #5495 -->
Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,
<!-- Node #5496 -->
Which is a great way growing on the south,
<!-- Node #5497 -->
Weighing the youthful season of the year.
<!-- Node #5498 -->
Some two months hence up higher toward the north
<!-- Node #5499 -->
He first presents his fire; and the high east
<!-- Node #5500 -->
Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.
<!-- Node #5501 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5502 -->
Give me your hands all over, one by one.
<!-- Node #5503 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5504 -->
And let us swear our resolution.
<!-- Node #5505 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5506 -->
No, not an oath: if not the face of men,
<!-- Node #5507 -->
The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--
<!-- Node #5508 -->
If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
<!-- Node #5509 -->
And every man hence to his idle bed;
<!-- Node #5510 -->
So let high-sighted tyranny range on,
<!-- Node #5511 -->
Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,
<!-- Node #5512 -->
As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
<!-- Node #5513 -->
To kindle cowards and to steel with valour
<!-- Node #5514 -->
The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
<!-- Node #5515 -->
What need we any spur but our own cause,
<!-- Node #5516 -->
To prick us to redress? what other bond
<!-- Node #5517 -->
Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,
<!-- Node #5518 -->
And will not palter? and what other oath
<!-- Node #5519 -->
Than honesty to honesty engaged,
<!-- Node #5520 -->
That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
<!-- Node #5521 -->
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,
<!-- Node #5522 -->
Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
<!-- Node #5523 -->
That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
<!-- Node #5524 -->
Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
<!-- Node #5525 -->
The even virtue of our enterprise,
<!-- Node #5526 -->
Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
<!-- Node #5527 -->
To think that or our cause or our performance
<!-- Node #5528 -->
Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
<!-- Node #5529 -->
That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
<!-- Node #5530 -->
Is guilty of a several bastardy,
<!-- Node #5531 -->
If he do break the smallest particle
<!-- Node #5532 -->
Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.
<!-- Node #5533 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5534 -->
But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?
<!-- Node #5535 -->
I think he will stand very strong with us.
<!-- Node #5536 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5537 -->
Let us not leave him out.
<!-- Node #5538 -->
CINNA
<!-- Node #5539 -->
No, by no means.
<!-- Node #5540 -->
METELLUS CIMBER
<!-- Node #5541 -->
O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
<!-- Node #5542 -->
Will purchase us a good opinion
<!-- Node #5543 -->
And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:
<!-- Node #5544 -->
It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;
<!-- Node #5545 -->
Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,
<!-- Node #5546 -->
But all be buried in his gravity.
<!-- Node #5547 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5548 -->
O, name him not: let us not break with him;
<!-- Node #5549 -->
For he will never follow any thing
<!-- Node #5550 -->
That other men begin.
<!-- Node #5551 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5552 -->
Then leave him out.
<!-- Node #5553 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #5554 -->
Indeed he is not fit.
<!-- Node #5555 -->
DECIUS BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5556 -->
Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
<!-- Node #5557 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5558 -->
Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
<!-- Node #5559 -->
Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
<!-- Node #5560 -->
Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him
<!-- Node #5561 -->
A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,
<!-- Node #5562 -->
If he improve them, may well stretch so far
<!-- Node #5563 -->
As to annoy us all: which to prevent,
<!-- Node #5564 -->
Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
<!-- Node #5565 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5566 -->
Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
<!-- Node #5567 -->
To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,
<!-- Node #5568 -->
Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
<!-- Node #5569 -->
For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:
<!-- Node #5570 -->
Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
<!-- Node #5571 -->
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;
<!-- Node #5572 -->
And in the spirit of men there is no blood:
<!-- Node #5573 -->
O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,
<!-- Node #5574 -->
And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
<!-- Node #5575 -->
Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
<!-- Node #5576 -->
Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
<!-- Node #5577 -->
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
<!-- Node #5578 -->
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
<!-- Node #5579 -->
And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
<!-- Node #5580 -->
Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
<!-- Node #5581 -->
And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
<!-- Node #5582 -->
Our purpose necessary and not envious:
<!-- Node #5583 -->
Which so appearing to the common eyes,
<!-- Node #5584 -->
We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
<!-- Node #5585 -->
And for Mark Antony, think not of him;
<!-- Node #5586 -->
For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
<!-- Node #5587 -->
When Caesar's head is off.
<!-- Node #5588 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5589 -->
Yet I fear him;
<!-- Node #5590 -->
For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--
<!-- Node #5591 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5592 -->
Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:
<!-- Node #5593 -->
If he love Caesar, all that he can do
<!-- Node #5594 -->
Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:
<!-- Node #5595 -->
And that were much he should; for he is given
<!-- Node #5596 -->
To sports, to wildness and much company.
<!-- Node #5597 -->
TREBONIUS
<!-- Node #5598 -->
There is no fear in him; let him not die;
<!-- Node #5599 -->
For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.
<!-- Node #5600 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5601 -->
Peace! count the clock.
<!-- Node #5602 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5603 -->
The clock hath stricken three.
<!-- Node #5604 -->
TREBONIUS
<!-- Node #5605 -->
'Tis time to part.
<!-- Node #5606 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5607 -->
But it is doubtful yet,
<!-- Node #5608 -->
Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;
<!-- Node #5609 -->
For he is superstitious grown of late,
<!-- Node #5610 -->
Quite from the main opinion he held once
<!-- Node #5611 -->
Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:
<!-- Node #5612 -->
It may be, these apparent prodigies,
<!-- Node #5613 -->
The unaccustom'd terror of this night,
<!-- Node #5614 -->
And the persuasion of his augurers,
<!-- Node #5615 -->
May hold him from the Capitol to-day.
<!-- Node #5616 -->
DECIUS BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5617 -->
Never fear that: if he be so resolved,
<!-- Node #5618 -->
I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear
<!-- Node #5619 -->
That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,
<!-- Node #5620 -->
And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
<!-- Node #5621 -->
Lions with toils and men with flatterers;
<!-- Node #5622 -->
But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
<!-- Node #5623 -->
He says he does, being then most flattered.
<!-- Node #5624 -->
Let me work;
<!-- Node #5625 -->
For I can give his humour the true bent,
<!-- Node #5626 -->
And I will bring him to the Capitol.
<!-- Node #5627 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5628 -->
Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
<!-- Node #5629 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5630 -->
By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?
<!-- Node #5631 -->
CINNA
<!-- Node #5632 -->
Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
<!-- Node #5633 -->
METELLUS CIMBER
<!-- Node #5634 -->
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
<!-- Node #5635 -->
Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:
<!-- Node #5636 -->
I wonder none of you have thought of him.
<!-- Node #5637 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5638 -->
Now, good Metellus, go along by him:
<!-- Node #5639 -->
He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;
<!-- Node #5640 -->
Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.
<!-- Node #5641 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #5642 -->
The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.
<!-- Node #5643 -->
And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember
<!-- Node #5644 -->
What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.
<!-- Node #5645 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5646 -->
Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
<!-- Node #5647 -->
Let not our looks put on our purposes,
<!-- Node #5648 -->
But bear it as our Roman actors do,
<!-- Node #5649 -->
With untired spirits and formal constancy:
<!-- Node #5650 -->
And so good morrow to you every one.
<!-- Node #5651 -->
Exeunt all but BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5652 -->
Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;
<!-- Node #5653 -->
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:
<!-- Node #5654 -->
Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
<!-- Node #5655 -->
Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
<!-- Node #5656 -->
Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
<!-- Node #5657 -->
PORTIA
<!-- Node #5658 -->
Brutus, my lord!
<!-- Node #5659 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5660 -->
Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?
<!-- Node #5661 -->
It is not for your health thus to commit
<!-- Node #5662 -->
Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.
<!-- Node #5663 -->
PORTIA
<!-- Node #5664 -->
Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,
<!-- Node #5665 -->
Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,
<!-- Node #5666 -->
You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,
<!-- Node #5667 -->
Musing and sighing, with your arms across,
<!-- Node #5668 -->
And when I ask'd you what the matter was,
<!-- Node #5669 -->
You stared upon me with ungentle looks;
<!-- Node #5670 -->
I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,
<!-- Node #5671 -->
And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;
<!-- Node #5672 -->
Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
<!-- Node #5673 -->
But, with an angry wafture of your hand,
<!-- Node #5674 -->
Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;
<!-- Node #5675 -->
Fearing to strengthen that impatience
<!-- Node #5676 -->
Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal
<!-- Node #5677 -->
Hoping it was but an effect of humour,
<!-- Node #5678 -->
Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
<!-- Node #5679 -->
It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
<!-- Node #5680 -->
And could it work so much upon your shape
<!-- Node #5681 -->
As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,
<!-- Node #5682 -->
I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,
<!-- Node #5683 -->
Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
<!-- Node #5684 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5685 -->
I am not well in health, and that is all.
<!-- Node #5686 -->
PORTIA
<!-- Node #5687 -->
Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
<!-- Node #5688 -->
He would embrace the means to come by it.
<!-- Node #5689 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5690 -->
Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
<!-- Node #5691 -->
PORTIA
<!-- Node #5692 -->
Is Brutus sick? and is it physical
<!-- Node #5693 -->
To walk unbraced and suck up the humours
<!-- Node #5694 -->
Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
<!-- Node #5695 -->
And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,
<!-- Node #5696 -->
To dare the vile contagion of the night
<!-- Node #5697 -->
And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
<!-- Node #5698 -->
To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;
<!-- Node #5699 -->
You have some sick offence within your mind,
<!-- Node #5700 -->
Which, by the right and virtue of my place,
<!-- Node #5701 -->
I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,
<!-- Node #5702 -->
I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,
<!-- Node #5703 -->
By all your vows of love and that great vow
<!-- Node #5704 -->
Which did incorporate and make us one,
<!-- Node #5705 -->
That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
<!-- Node #5706 -->
Why you are heavy, and what men to-night
<!-- Node #5707 -->
Have had to resort to you: for here have been
<!-- Node #5708 -->
Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
<!-- Node #5709 -->
Even from darkness.
<!-- Node #5710 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5711 -->
Kneel not, gentle Portia.
<!-- Node #5712 -->
PORTIA
<!-- Node #5713 -->
I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
<!-- Node #5714 -->
Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
<!-- Node #5715 -->
Is it excepted I should know no secrets
<!-- Node #5716 -->
That appertain to you? Am I yourself
<!-- Node #5717 -->
But, as it were, in sort or limitation,
<!-- Node #5718 -->
To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
<!-- Node #5719 -->
And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
<!-- Node #5720 -->
Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
<!-- Node #5721 -->
Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.
<!-- Node #5722 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5723 -->
You are my true and honourable wife,
<!-- Node #5724 -->
As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
<!-- Node #5725 -->
That visit my sad heart
<!-- Node #5726 -->
PORTIA
<!-- Node #5727 -->
If this were true, then should I know this secret.
<!-- Node #5728 -->
I grant I am a woman; but withal
<!-- Node #5729 -->
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:
<!-- Node #5730 -->
I grant I am a woman; but withal
<!-- Node #5731 -->
A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.
<!-- Node #5732 -->
Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
<!-- Node #5733 -->
Being so father'd and so husbanded?
<!-- Node #5734 -->
Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:
<!-- Node #5735 -->
I have made strong proof of my constancy,
<!-- Node #5736 -->
Giving myself a voluntary wound
<!-- Node #5737 -->
Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.
<!-- Node #5738 -->
And not my husband's secrets?
<!-- Node #5739 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5740 -->
O ye gods,
<!-- Node #5741 -->
Render me worthy of this noble wife!
<!-- Node #5742 -->
Knocking within
<!-- Node #5743 -->
Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;
<!-- Node #5744 -->
And by and by thy bosom shall partake
<!-- Node #5745 -->
The secrets of my heart.
<!-- Node #5746 -->
All my engagements I will construe to thee,
<!-- Node #5747 -->
All the charactery of my sad brows:
<!-- Node #5748 -->
Leave me with haste.
<!-- Node #5749 -->
Exit PORTIA
<!-- Node #5750 -->
Lucius, who's that knocks?
<!-- Node #5751 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #5752 -->
He is a sick man that would speak with you.
<!-- Node #5753 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5754 -->
Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
<!-- Node #5755 -->
Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?
<!-- Node #5756 -->
LIGARIUS
<!-- Node #5757 -->
Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
<!-- Node #5758 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5759 -->
O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
<!-- Node #5760 -->
To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!
<!-- Node #5761 -->
LIGARIUS
<!-- Node #5762 -->
I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
<!-- Node #5763 -->
Any exploit worthy the name of honour.
<!-- Node #5764 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5765 -->
Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
<!-- Node #5766 -->
Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.
<!-- Node #5767 -->
LIGARIUS
<!-- Node #5768 -->
By all the gods that Romans bow before,
<!-- Node #5769 -->
I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!
<!-- Node #5770 -->
Brave son, derived from honourable loins!
<!-- Node #5771 -->
Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up
<!-- Node #5772 -->
My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,
<!-- Node #5773 -->
And I will strive with things impossible;
<!-- Node #5774 -->
Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?
<!-- Node #5775 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5776 -->
A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
<!-- Node #5777 -->
LIGARIUS
<!-- Node #5778 -->
But are not some whole that we must make sick?
<!-- Node #5779 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5780 -->
That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
<!-- Node #5781 -->
I shall unfold to thee, as we are going
<!-- Node #5782 -->
To whom it must be done.
<!-- Node #5783 -->
LIGARIUS
<!-- Node #5784 -->
Set on your foot,
<!-- Node #5785 -->
And with a heart new-fired I follow you,
<!-- Node #5786 -->
To do I know not what: but it sufficeth
<!-- Node #5787 -->
That Brutus leads me on.
<!-- Node #5788 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5789 -->
Follow me, then.
<!-- Node #5790 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #5791 -->
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:
<!-- Node #5792 -->
Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,
<!-- Node #5793 -->
'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's within?
<!-- Node #5794 -->
Servant
<!-- Node #5795 -->
My lord?
<!-- Node #5796 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #5797 -->
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice
<!-- Node #5798 -->
And bring me their opinions of success.
<!-- Node #5799 -->
Servant
<!-- Node #5800 -->
I will, my lord.
<!-- Node #5801 -->
CALPURNIA
<!-- Node #5802 -->
What mean you, Caesar? think you to walk forth?
<!-- Node #5803 -->
You shall not stir out of your house to-day.
<!-- Node #5804 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #5805 -->
Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
<!-- Node #5806 -->
Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see
<!-- Node #5807 -->
The face of Caesar, they are vanished.
<!-- Node #5808 -->
CALPURNIA
<!-- Node #5809 -->
Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,
<!-- Node #5810 -->
Yet now they fright me. There is one within,
<!-- Node #5811 -->
Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
<!-- Node #5812 -->
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
<!-- Node #5813 -->
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
<!-- Node #5814 -->
And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;
<!-- Node #5815 -->
Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,
<!-- Node #5816 -->
In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
<!-- Node #5817 -->
Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;
<!-- Node #5818 -->
The noise of battle hurtled in the air,
<!-- Node #5819 -->
Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,
<!-- Node #5820 -->
And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
<!-- Node #5821 -->
O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,
<!-- Node #5822 -->
And I do fear them.
<!-- Node #5823 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #5824 -->
What can be avoided
<!-- Node #5825 -->
Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
<!-- Node #5826 -->
Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions
<!-- Node #5827 -->
Are to the world in general as to Caesar.
<!-- Node #5828 -->
CALPURNIA
<!-- Node #5829 -->
When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
<!-- Node #5830 -->
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.
<!-- Node #5831 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #5832 -->
Cowards die many times before their deaths;
<!-- Node #5833 -->
The valiant never taste of death but once.
<!-- Node #5834 -->
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.
<!-- Node #5835 -->
It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
<!-- Node #5836 -->
Seeing that death, a necessary end,
<!-- Node #5837 -->
Will come when it will come.
<!-- Node #5838 -->
Re-enter Servant
<!-- Node #5839 -->
What say the augurers?
<!-- Node #5840 -->
Servant
<!-- Node #5841 -->
They would not have you to stir forth to-day.
<!-- Node #5842 -->
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,
<!-- Node #5843 -->
They could not find a heart within the beast.
<!-- Node #5844 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #5845 -->
The gods do this in shame of cowardice:
<!-- Node #5846 -->
Caesar should be a beast without a heart,
<!-- Node #5847 -->
If he should stay at home to-day for fear.
<!-- Node #5848 -->
No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well
<!-- Node #5849 -->
That Caesar is more dangerous than he:
<!-- Node #5850 -->
We are two lions litter'd in one day,
<!-- Node #5851 -->
And I the elder and more terrible:
<!-- Node #5852 -->
And Caesar shall go forth.
<!-- Node #5853 -->
CALPURNIA
<!-- Node #5854 -->
Alas, my lord,
<!-- Node #5855 -->
Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.
<!-- Node #5856 -->
Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear
<!-- Node #5857 -->
That keeps you in the house, and not your own.
<!-- Node #5858 -->
We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:
<!-- Node #5859 -->
And he shall say you are not well to-day:
<!-- Node #5860 -->
Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.
<!-- Node #5861 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #5862 -->
Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
<!-- Node #5863 -->
And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.
<!-- Node #5864 -->
Enter DECIUS BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5865 -->
Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.
<!-- Node #5866 -->
DECIUS BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5867 -->
Caesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Caesar:
<!-- Node #5868 -->
I come to fetch you to the senate-house.
<!-- Node #5869 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #5870 -->
And you are come in very happy time,
<!-- Node #5871 -->
To bear my greeting to the senators
<!-- Node #5872 -->
And tell them that I will not come to-day:
<!-- Node #5873 -->
Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:
<!-- Node #5874 -->
I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.
<!-- Node #5875 -->
CALPURNIA
<!-- Node #5876 -->
Say he is sick.
<!-- Node #5877 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #5878 -->
Shall Caesar send a lie?
<!-- Node #5879 -->
Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,
<!-- Node #5880 -->
To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?
<!-- Node #5881 -->
Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
<!-- Node #5882 -->
DECIUS BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5883 -->
Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
<!-- Node #5884 -->
Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.
<!-- Node #5885 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #5886 -->
The cause is in my will: I will not come;
<!-- Node #5887 -->
That is enough to satisfy the senate.
<!-- Node #5888 -->
But for your private satisfaction,
<!-- Node #5889 -->
Because I love you, I will let you know:
<!-- Node #5890 -->
Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:
<!-- Node #5891 -->
She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,
<!-- Node #5892 -->
Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,
<!-- Node #5893 -->
Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans
<!-- Node #5894 -->
Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:
<!-- Node #5895 -->
And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,
<!-- Node #5896 -->
And evils imminent; and on her knee
<!-- Node #5897 -->
Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.
<!-- Node #5898 -->
DECIUS BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5899 -->
This dream is all amiss interpreted;
<!-- Node #5900 -->
It was a vision fair and fortunate:
<!-- Node #5901 -->
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
<!-- Node #5902 -->
In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
<!-- Node #5903 -->
Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
<!-- Node #5904 -->
Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
<!-- Node #5905 -->
For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.
<!-- Node #5906 -->
This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.
<!-- Node #5907 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #5908 -->
And this way have you well expounded it.
<!-- Node #5909 -->
DECIUS BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5910 -->
I have, when you have heard what I can say:
<!-- Node #5911 -->
And know it now: the senate have concluded
<!-- Node #5912 -->
To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
<!-- Node #5913 -->
If you shall send them word you will not come,
<!-- Node #5914 -->
Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
<!-- Node #5915 -->
Apt to be render'd, for some one to say
<!-- Node #5916 -->
'Break up the senate till another time,
<!-- Node #5917 -->
When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'
<!-- Node #5918 -->
If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
<!-- Node #5919 -->
'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?
<!-- Node #5920 -->
Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love
<!-- Node #5921 -->
To our proceeding bids me tell you this;
<!-- Node #5922 -->
And reason to my love is liable.
<!-- Node #5923 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #5924 -->
How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!
<!-- Node #5925 -->
I am ashamed I did yield to them.
<!-- Node #5926 -->
Give me my robe, for I will go.
<!-- Node #5927 -->
Enter PUBLIUS, BRUTUS, LIGARIUS, METELLUS, CASCA,
TREBONIUS, and CINNA
<!-- Node #5928 -->
And look where Publius is come to fetch me.
<!-- Node #5929 -->
PUBLIUS
<!-- Node #5930 -->
Good morrow, Caesar.
<!-- Node #5931 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #5932 -->
Welcome, Publius.
<!-- Node #5933 -->
What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?
<!-- Node #5934 -->
Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,
<!-- Node #5935 -->
Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy
<!-- Node #5936 -->
As that same ague which hath made you lean.
<!-- Node #5937 -->
What is 't o'clock?
<!-- Node #5938 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5939 -->
Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.
<!-- Node #5940 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #5941 -->
I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
<!-- Node #5942 -->
Enter ANTONY
<!-- Node #5943 -->
See! Antony, that revels long o' nights,
<!-- Node #5944 -->
Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.
<!-- Node #5945 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #5946 -->
So to most noble Caesar.
<!-- Node #5947 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #5948 -->
Bid them prepare within:
<!-- Node #5949 -->
I am to blame to be thus waited for.
<!-- Node #5950 -->
Now, Cinna: now, Metellus: what, Trebonius!
<!-- Node #5951 -->
I have an hour's talk in store for you;
<!-- Node #5952 -->
Remember that you call on me to-day:
<!-- Node #5953 -->
Be near me, that I may remember you.
<!-- Node #5954 -->
TREBONIUS
<!-- Node #5955 -->
Caesar, I will:
<!-- Node #5956 -->
Aside
<!-- Node #5957 -->
and so near will I be,
<!-- Node #5958 -->
That your best friends shall wish I had been further.
<!-- Node #5959 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #5960 -->
Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me;
<!-- Node #5961 -->
And we, like friends, will straightway go together.
<!-- Node #5962 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #5963 -->
<STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>
<!-- Node #5964 -->
That every like is not the same, O Caesar,
<!-- Node #5965 -->
The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!
<!-- Node #5966 -->
ARTEMIDORUS
<!-- Node #5967 -->
'Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius;
<!-- Node #5968 -->
come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna, trust not
<!-- Node #5969 -->
Trebonius: mark well Metellus Cimber: Decius Brutus
<!-- Node #5970 -->
loves thee not: thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.
<!-- Node #5971 -->
There is but one mind in all these men, and it is
<!-- Node #5972 -->
bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal,
<!-- Node #5973 -->
look about you: security gives way to conspiracy.
<!-- Node #5974 -->
The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover,
<!-- Node #5975 -->
'ARTEMIDORUS.'
<!-- Node #5976 -->
Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,
<!-- Node #5977 -->
And as a suitor will I give him this.
<!-- Node #5978 -->
My heart laments that virtue cannot live
<!-- Node #5979 -->
Out of the teeth of emulation.
<!-- Node #5980 -->
If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live;
<!-- Node #5981 -->
If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.
<!-- Node #5982 -->
PORTIA
<!-- Node #5983 -->
I prithee, boy, run to the senate-house;
<!-- Node #5984 -->
Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone:
<!-- Node #5985 -->
Why dost thou stay?
<!-- Node #5986 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #5987 -->
To know my errand, madam.
<!-- Node #5988 -->
PORTIA
<!-- Node #5989 -->
I would have had thee there, and here again,
<!-- Node #5990 -->
Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
<!-- Node #5991 -->
O constancy, be strong upon my side,
<!-- Node #5992 -->
Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!
<!-- Node #5993 -->
I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.
<!-- Node #5994 -->
How hard it is for women to keep counsel!
<!-- Node #5995 -->
Art thou here yet?
<!-- Node #5996 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #5997 -->
Madam, what should I do?
<!-- Node #5998 -->
Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
<!-- Node #5999 -->
And so return to you, and nothing else?
<!-- Node #6000 -->
PORTIA
<!-- Node #6001 -->
Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
<!-- Node #6002 -->
For he went sickly forth: and take good note
<!-- Node #6003 -->
What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
<!-- Node #6004 -->
Hark, boy! what noise is that?
<!-- Node #6005 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #6006 -->
I hear none, madam.
<!-- Node #6007 -->
PORTIA
<!-- Node #6008 -->
Prithee, listen well;
<!-- Node #6009 -->
I heard a bustling rumour, like a fray,
<!-- Node #6010 -->
And the wind brings it from the Capitol.
<!-- Node #6011 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #6012 -->
Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
<!-- Node #6013 -->
PORTIA
<!-- Node #6014 -->
Come hither, fellow: which way hast thou been?
<!-- Node #6015 -->
Soothsayer
<!-- Node #6016 -->
At mine own house, good lady.
<!-- Node #6017 -->
PORTIA
<!-- Node #6018 -->
What is't o'clock?
<!-- Node #6019 -->
Soothsayer
<!-- Node #6020 -->
About the ninth hour, lady.
<!-- Node #6021 -->
PORTIA
<!-- Node #6022 -->
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
<!-- Node #6023 -->
Soothsayer
<!-- Node #6024 -->
Madam, not yet: I go to take my stand,
<!-- Node #6025 -->
To see him pass on to the Capitol.
<!-- Node #6026 -->
PORTIA
<!-- Node #6027 -->
Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
<!-- Node #6028 -->
Soothsayer
<!-- Node #6029 -->
That I have, lady: if it will please Caesar
<!-- Node #6030 -->
To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,
<!-- Node #6031 -->
I shall beseech him to befriend himself.
<!-- Node #6032 -->
PORTIA
<!-- Node #6033 -->
Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?
<!-- Node #6034 -->
Soothsayer
<!-- Node #6035 -->
None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
<!-- Node #6036 -->
Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow:
<!-- Node #6037 -->
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
<!-- Node #6038 -->
Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,
<!-- Node #6039 -->
Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:
<!-- Node #6040 -->
I'll get me to a place more void, and there
<!-- Node #6041 -->
Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
<!-- Node #6042 -->
PORTIA
<!-- Node #6043 -->
I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing
<!-- Node #6044 -->
The heart of woman is! O Brutus,
<!-- Node #6045 -->
The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!
<!-- Node #6046 -->
Sure, the boy heard me: Brutus hath a suit
<!-- Node #6047 -->
That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.
<!-- Node #6048 -->
Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
<!-- Node #6049 -->
Say I am merry: come to me again,
<!-- Node #6050 -->
And bring me word what he doth say to thee.
<!-- Node #6051 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #6052 -->
<STAGEDIR>To the Soothsayer</STAGEDIR>
<!-- Node #6053 -->
The ides of March are come.
<!-- Node #6054 -->
Soothsayer
<!-- Node #6055 -->
Ay, Caesar; but not gone.
<!-- Node #6056 -->
ARTEMIDORUS
<!-- Node #6057 -->
Hail, Caesar! read this schedule.
<!-- Node #6058 -->
DECIUS BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6059 -->
Trebonius doth desire you to o'erread,
<!-- Node #6060 -->
At your best leisure, this his humble suit.
<!-- Node #6061 -->
ARTEMIDORUS
<!-- Node #6062 -->
O Caesar, read mine first; for mine's a suit
<!-- Node #6063 -->
That touches Caesar nearer: read it, great Caesar.
<!-- Node #6064 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #6065 -->
What touches us ourself shall be last served.
<!-- Node #6066 -->
ARTEMIDORUS
<!-- Node #6067 -->
Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.
<!-- Node #6068 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #6069 -->
What, is the fellow mad?
<!-- Node #6070 -->
PUBLIUS
<!-- Node #6071 -->
Sirrah, give place.
<!-- Node #6072 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #6073 -->
What, urge you your petitions in the street?
<!-- Node #6074 -->
Come to the Capitol.
<!-- Node #6075 -->
POPILIUS
<!-- Node #6076 -->
I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.
<!-- Node #6077 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #6078 -->
What enterprise, Popilius?
<!-- Node #6079 -->
POPILIUS
<!-- Node #6080 -->
Fare you well.
<!-- Node #6081 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6082 -->
What said Popilius Lena?
<!-- Node #6083 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #6084 -->
He wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive.
<!-- Node #6085 -->
I fear our purpose is discovered.
<!-- Node #6086 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6087 -->
Look, how he makes to Caesar; mark him.
<!-- Node #6088 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #6089 -->
Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.
<!-- Node #6090 -->
Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,
<!-- Node #6091 -->
Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,
<!-- Node #6092 -->
For I will slay myself.
<!-- Node #6093 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6094 -->
Cassius, be constant:
<!-- Node #6095 -->
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;
<!-- Node #6096 -->
For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.
<!-- Node #6097 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #6098 -->
Trebonius knows his time; for, look you, Brutus.
<!-- Node #6099 -->
He draws Mark Antony out of the way.
<!-- Node #6100 -->
DECIUS BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6101 -->
Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,
<!-- Node #6102 -->
And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.
<!-- Node #6103 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6104 -->
He is address'd: press near and second him.
<!-- Node #6105 -->
CINNA
<!-- Node #6106 -->
Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.
<!-- Node #6107 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #6108 -->
Are we all ready? What is now amiss
<!-- Node #6109 -->
That Caesar and his senate must redress?
<!-- Node #6110 -->
METELLUS CIMBER
<!-- Node #6111 -->
Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,
<!-- Node #6112 -->
Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
<!-- Node #6113 -->
An humble heart,--
<!-- Node #6114 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #6115 -->
I must prevent thee, Cimber.
<!-- Node #6116 -->
These couchings and these lowly courtesies
<!-- Node #6117 -->
Might fire the blood of ordinary men,
<!-- Node #6118 -->
And turn pre-ordinance and first decree
<!-- Node #6119 -->
Into the law of children. Be not fond,
<!-- Node #6120 -->
To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
<!-- Node #6121 -->
That will be thaw'd from the true quality
<!-- Node #6122 -->
With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,
<!-- Node #6123 -->
Low-crooked court'sies and base spaniel-fawning.
<!-- Node #6124 -->
Thy brother by decree is banished:
<!-- Node #6125 -->
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,
<!-- Node #6126 -->
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
<!-- Node #6127 -->
Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause
<!-- Node #6128 -->
Will he be satisfied.
<!-- Node #6129 -->
METELLUS CIMBER
<!-- Node #6130 -->
Is there no voice more worthy than my own
<!-- Node #6131 -->
To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear
<!-- Node #6132 -->
For the repealing of my banish'd brother?
<!-- Node #6133 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6134 -->
I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;
<!-- Node #6135 -->
Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
<!-- Node #6136 -->
Have an immediate freedom of repeal.
<!-- Node #6137 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #6138 -->
What, Brutus!
<!-- Node #6139 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #6140 -->
Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:
<!-- Node #6141 -->
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,
<!-- Node #6142 -->
To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.
<!-- Node #6143 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #6144 -->
I could be well moved, if I were as you:
<!-- Node #6145 -->
If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:
<!-- Node #6146 -->
But I am constant as the northern star,
<!-- Node #6147 -->
Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality
<!-- Node #6148 -->
There is no fellow in the firmament.
<!-- Node #6149 -->
The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,
<!-- Node #6150 -->
They are all fire and every one doth shine,
<!-- Node #6151 -->
But there's but one in all doth hold his place:
<!-- Node #6152 -->
So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,
<!-- Node #6153 -->
And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;
<!-- Node #6154 -->
Yet in the number I do know but one
<!-- Node #6155 -->
That unassailable holds on his rank,
<!-- Node #6156 -->
Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,
<!-- Node #6157 -->
Let me a little show it, even in this;
<!-- Node #6158 -->
That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,
<!-- Node #6159 -->
And constant do remain to keep him so.
<!-- Node #6160 -->
CINNA
<!-- Node #6161 -->
O Caesar,--
<!-- Node #6162 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #6163 -->
Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?
<!-- Node #6164 -->
DECIUS BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6165 -->
Great Caesar,--
<!-- Node #6166 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #6167 -->
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
<!-- Node #6168 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #6169 -->
Speak, hands for me!
<!-- Node #6170 -->
CAESAR
<!-- Node #6171 -->
Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.
<!-- Node #6172 -->
CINNA
<!-- Node #6173 -->
Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!
<!-- Node #6174 -->
Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
<!-- Node #6175 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #6176 -->
Some to the common pulpits, and cry out
<!-- Node #6177 -->
'Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!'
<!-- Node #6178 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6179 -->
People and senators, be not affrighted;
<!-- Node #6180 -->
Fly not; stand stiff: ambition's debt is paid.
<!-- Node #6181 -->
CASCA
<!-- Node #6182 -->
Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
<!-- Node #6183 -->
DECIUS BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6184 -->
And Cassius too.
<!-- Node #6185 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6186 -->
Where's Publius?
<!-- Node #6187 -->
CINNA
<!-- Node #6188 -->
Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.
<!-- Node #6189 -->
METELLUS CIMBER
<!-- Node #6190 -->
Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's
<!-- Node #6191 -->
Should chance--
<!-- Node #6192 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6193 -->
Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer;
<!-- Node #6194 -->
There is no harm intended to your person,
<!-- Node #6195 -->
Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius.
<!-- Node #6196 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #6197 -->
And leave us, Publius; lest that the people,
<!-- Node #6198 -->
Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.
<!-- Node #6199 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6200 -->
Do so: and let no man abide this deed,
<!-- Node #6201 -->
But we the doers.
<!-- Node #6202 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #6203 -->
Where is Antony?
<!-- Node #6204 -->
TREBONIUS
<!-- Node #6205 -->
Fled to his house amazed:
<!-- Node #6206 -->
Men, wives and children stare, cry out and run
<!-- Node #6207 -->
As it were doomsday.
<!-- Node #6208 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6209 -->
Fates, we will know your pleasures:
<!-- Node #6210 -->
That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time
<!-- Node #6211 -->
And drawing days out, that men stand upon.
<!-- Node #6212 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #6213 -->
Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
<!-- Node #6214 -->
Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
<!-- Node #6215 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6216 -->
Grant that, and then is death a benefit:
<!-- Node #6217 -->
So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged
<!-- Node #6218 -->
His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
<!-- Node #6219 -->
And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood
<!-- Node #6220 -->
Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:
<!-- Node #6221 -->
Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,
<!-- Node #6222 -->
And, waving our red weapons o'er our heads,
<!-- Node #6223 -->
Let's all cry 'Peace, freedom and liberty!'
<!-- Node #6224 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #6225 -->
Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence
<!-- Node #6226 -->
Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
<!-- Node #6227 -->
In states unborn and accents yet unknown!
<!-- Node #6228 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6229 -->
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
<!-- Node #6230 -->
That now on Pompey's basis lies along
<!-- Node #6231 -->
No worthier than the dust!
<!-- Node #6232 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #6233 -->
So oft as that shall be,
<!-- Node #6234 -->
So often shall the knot of us be call'd
<!-- Node #6235 -->
The men that gave their country liberty.
<!-- Node #6236 -->
DECIUS BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6237 -->
What, shall we forth?
<!-- Node #6238 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #6239 -->
Ay, every man away:
<!-- Node #6240 -->
Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels
<!-- Node #6241 -->
With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
<!-- Node #6242 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6243 -->
Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.
<!-- Node #6244 -->
Servant
<!-- Node #6245 -->
Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:
<!-- Node #6246 -->
Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;
<!-- Node #6247 -->
And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:
<!-- Node #6248 -->
Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;
<!-- Node #6249 -->
Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:
<!-- Node #6250 -->
Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;
<!-- Node #6251 -->
Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him and loved him.
<!-- Node #6252 -->
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
<!-- Node #6253 -->
May safely come to him, and be resolved
<!-- Node #6254 -->
How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,
<!-- Node #6255 -->
Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
<!-- Node #6256 -->
So well as Brutus living; but will follow
<!-- Node #6257 -->
The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
<!-- Node #6258 -->
Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
<!-- Node #6259 -->
With all true faith. So says my master Antony.
<!-- Node #6260 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6261 -->
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;
<!-- Node #6262 -->
I never thought him worse.
<!-- Node #6263 -->
Tell him, so please him come unto this place,
<!-- Node #6264 -->
He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour,
<!-- Node #6265 -->
Depart untouch'd.
<!-- Node #6266 -->
Servant
<!-- Node #6267 -->
I'll fetch him presently.
<!-- Node #6268 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6269 -->
I know that we shall have him well to friend.
<!-- Node #6270 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #6271 -->
I wish we may: but yet have I a mind
<!-- Node #6272 -->
That fears him much; and my misgiving still
<!-- Node #6273 -->
Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
<!-- Node #6274 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6275 -->
But here comes Antony.
<!-- Node #6276 -->
Re-enter ANTONY
<!-- Node #6277 -->
Welcome, Mark Antony.
<!-- Node #6278 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6279 -->
O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?
<!-- Node #6280 -->
Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
<!-- Node #6281 -->
Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.
<!-- Node #6282 -->
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
<!-- Node #6283 -->
Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:
<!-- Node #6284 -->
If I myself, there is no hour so fit
<!-- Node #6285 -->
As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument
<!-- Node #6286 -->
Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
<!-- Node #6287 -->
With the most noble blood of all this world.
<!-- Node #6288 -->
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
<!-- Node #6289 -->
Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
<!-- Node #6290 -->
Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,
<!-- Node #6291 -->
I shall not find myself so apt to die:
<!-- Node #6292 -->
No place will please me so, no mean of death,
<!-- Node #6293 -->
As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,
<!-- Node #6294 -->
The choice and master spirits of this age.
<!-- Node #6295 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6296 -->
O Antony, beg not your death of us.
<!-- Node #6297 -->
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,
<!-- Node #6298 -->
As, by our hands and this our present act,
<!-- Node #6299 -->
You see we do, yet see you but our hands
<!-- Node #6300 -->
And this the bleeding business they have done:
<!-- Node #6301 -->
Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;
<!-- Node #6302 -->
And pity to the general wrong of Rome--
<!-- Node #6303 -->
As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--
<!-- Node #6304 -->
Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
<!-- Node #6305 -->
To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:
<!-- Node #6306 -->
Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts
<!-- Node #6307 -->
Of brothers' temper, do receive you in
<!-- Node #6308 -->
With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
<!-- Node #6309 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #6310 -->
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
<!-- Node #6311 -->
In the disposing of new dignities.
<!-- Node #6312 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6313 -->
Only be patient till we have appeased
<!-- Node #6314 -->
The multitude, beside themselves with fear,
<!-- Node #6315 -->
And then we will deliver you the cause,
<!-- Node #6316 -->
Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,
<!-- Node #6317 -->
Have thus proceeded.
<!-- Node #6318 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6319 -->
I doubt not of your wisdom.
<!-- Node #6320 -->
Let each man render me his bloody hand:
<!-- Node #6321 -->
First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;
<!-- Node #6322 -->
Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;
<!-- Node #6323 -->
Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;
<!-- Node #6324 -->
Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;
<!-- Node #6325 -->
Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.
<!-- Node #6326 -->
Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?
<!-- Node #6327 -->
My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
<!-- Node #6328 -->
That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,
<!-- Node #6329 -->
Either a coward or a flatterer.
<!-- Node #6330 -->
That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:
<!-- Node #6331 -->
If then thy spirit look upon us now,
<!-- Node #6332 -->
Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,
<!-- Node #6333 -->
To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,
<!-- Node #6334 -->
Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
<!-- Node #6335 -->
Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?
<!-- Node #6336 -->
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
<!-- Node #6337 -->
Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
<!-- Node #6338 -->
It would become me better than to close
<!-- Node #6339 -->
In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
<!-- Node #6340 -->
Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;
<!-- Node #6341 -->
Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,
<!-- Node #6342 -->
Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.
<!-- Node #6343 -->
O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;
<!-- Node #6344 -->
And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.
<!-- Node #6345 -->
How like a deer, strucken by many princes,
<!-- Node #6346 -->
Dost thou here lie!
<!-- Node #6347 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #6348 -->
Mark Antony,--
<!-- Node #6349 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6350 -->
Pardon me, Caius Cassius:
<!-- Node #6351 -->
The enemies of Caesar shall say this;
<!-- Node #6352 -->
Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.
<!-- Node #6353 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #6354 -->
I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
<!-- Node #6355 -->
But what compact mean you to have with us?
<!-- Node #6356 -->
Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;
<!-- Node #6357 -->
Or shall we on, and not depend on you?
<!-- Node #6358 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6359 -->
Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,
<!-- Node #6360 -->
Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar.
<!-- Node #6361 -->
Friends am I with you all and love you all,
<!-- Node #6362 -->
Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons
<!-- Node #6363 -->
Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.
<!-- Node #6364 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6365 -->
Or else were this a savage spectacle:
<!-- Node #6366 -->
Our reasons are so full of good regard
<!-- Node #6367 -->
That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,
<!-- Node #6368 -->
You should be satisfied.
<!-- Node #6369 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6370 -->
That's all I seek:
<!-- Node #6371 -->
And am moreover suitor that I may
<!-- Node #6372 -->
Produce his body to the market-place;
<!-- Node #6373 -->
And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
<!-- Node #6374 -->
Speak in the order of his funeral.
<!-- Node #6375 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6376 -->
You shall, Mark Antony.
<!-- Node #6377 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #6378 -->
Brutus, a word with you.
<!-- Node #6379 -->
Aside to BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6380 -->
You know not what you do: do not consent
<!-- Node #6381 -->
That Antony speak in his funeral:
<!-- Node #6382 -->
Know you how much the people may be moved
<!-- Node #6383 -->
By that which he will utter?
<!-- Node #6384 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6385 -->
By your pardon;
<!-- Node #6386 -->
I will myself into the pulpit first,
<!-- Node #6387 -->
And show the reason of our Caesar's death:
<!-- Node #6388 -->
What Antony shall speak, I will protest
<!-- Node #6389 -->
He speaks by leave and by permission,
<!-- Node #6390 -->
And that we are contented Caesar shall
<!-- Node #6391 -->
Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
<!-- Node #6392 -->
It shall advantage more than do us wrong.
<!-- Node #6393 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #6394 -->
I know not what may fall; I like it not.
<!-- Node #6395 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6396 -->
Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
<!-- Node #6397 -->
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,
<!-- Node #6398 -->
But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,
<!-- Node #6399 -->
And say you do't by our permission;
<!-- Node #6400 -->
Else shall you not have any hand at all
<!-- Node #6401 -->
About his funeral: and you shall speak
<!-- Node #6402 -->
In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
<!-- Node #6403 -->
After my speech is ended.
<!-- Node #6404 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6405 -->
Be it so.
<!-- Node #6406 -->
I do desire no more.
<!-- Node #6407 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6408 -->
Prepare the body then, and follow us.
<!-- Node #6409 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6410 -->
O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
<!-- Node #6411 -->
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
<!-- Node #6412 -->
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
<!-- Node #6413 -->
That ever lived in the tide of times.
<!-- Node #6414 -->
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
<!-- Node #6415 -->
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--
<!-- Node #6416 -->
Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,
<!-- Node #6417 -->
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--
<!-- Node #6418 -->
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
<!-- Node #6419 -->
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
<!-- Node #6420 -->
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
<!-- Node #6421 -->
Blood and destruction shall be so in use
<!-- Node #6422 -->
And dreadful objects so familiar
<!-- Node #6423 -->
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
<!-- Node #6424 -->
Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
<!-- Node #6425 -->
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:
<!-- Node #6426 -->
And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
<!-- Node #6427 -->
With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
<!-- Node #6428 -->
Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
<!-- Node #6429 -->
Cry  'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;
<!-- Node #6430 -->
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
<!-- Node #6431 -->
With carrion men, groaning for burial.
<!-- Node #6432 -->
Enter a Servant
<!-- Node #6433 -->
You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?
<!-- Node #6434 -->
Servant
<!-- Node #6435 -->
I do, Mark Antony.
<!-- Node #6436 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6437 -->
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
<!-- Node #6438 -->
Servant
<!-- Node #6439 -->
He did receive his letters, and is coming;
<!-- Node #6440 -->
And bid me say to you by word of mouth--
<!-- Node #6441 -->
O Caesar!--
<!-- Node #6442 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6443 -->
Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.
<!-- Node #6444 -->
Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,
<!-- Node #6445 -->
Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
<!-- Node #6446 -->
Began to water. Is thy master coming?
<!-- Node #6447 -->
Servant
<!-- Node #6448 -->
He lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome.
<!-- Node #6449 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6450 -->
Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced:
<!-- Node #6451 -->
Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
<!-- Node #6452 -->
No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;
<!-- Node #6453 -->
Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;
<!-- Node #6454 -->
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
<!-- Node #6455 -->
Into the market-place: there shall I try
<!-- Node #6456 -->
In my oration, how the people take
<!-- Node #6457 -->
The cruel issue of these bloody men;
<!-- Node #6458 -->
According to the which, thou shalt discourse
<!-- Node #6459 -->
To young Octavius of the state of things.
<!-- Node #6460 -->
Lend me your hand.
<!-- Node #6461 -->
Citizens
<!-- Node #6462 -->
We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.
<!-- Node #6463 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6464 -->
Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.
<!-- Node #6465 -->
Cassius, go you into the other street,
<!-- Node #6466 -->
And part the numbers.
<!-- Node #6467 -->
Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;
<!-- Node #6468 -->
Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;
<!-- Node #6469 -->
And public reasons shall be rendered
<!-- Node #6470 -->
Of Caesar's death.
<!-- Node #6471 -->
First Citizen
<!-- Node #6472 -->
I will hear Brutus speak.
<!-- Node #6473 -->
Second Citizen
<!-- Node #6474 -->
I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,
<!-- Node #6475 -->
When severally we hear them rendered.
<!-- Node #6476 -->
Third Citizen
<!-- Node #6477 -->
The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!
<!-- Node #6478 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6479 -->
Be patient till the last.
<!-- Node #6480 -->
Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my
<!-- Node #6481 -->
cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me
<!-- Node #6482 -->
for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that
<!-- Node #6483 -->
you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and
<!-- Node #6484 -->
awake your senses, that you may the better judge.
<!-- Node #6485 -->
If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
<!-- Node #6486 -->
Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar
<!-- Node #6487 -->
was no less than his. If then that friend demand
<!-- Node #6488 -->
why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:
<!-- Node #6489 -->
--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
<!-- Node #6490 -->
Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and
<!-- Node #6491 -->
die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live
<!-- Node #6492 -->
all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;
<!-- Node #6493 -->
as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
<!-- Node #6494 -->
valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I
<!-- Node #6495 -->
slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his
<!-- Node #6496 -->
fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his
<!-- Node #6497 -->
ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
<!-- Node #6498 -->
bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.
<!-- Node #6499 -->
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If
<!-- Node #6500 -->
any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so
<!-- Node #6501 -->
vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;
<!-- Node #6502 -->
for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.
<!-- Node #6503 -->
All
<!-- Node #6504 -->
None, Brutus, none.
<!-- Node #6505 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6506 -->
Then none have I offended. I have done no more to
<!-- Node #6507 -->
Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of
<!-- Node #6508 -->
his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not
<!-- Node #6509 -->
extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences
<!-- Node #6510 -->
enforced, for which he suffered death.
<!-- Node #6511 -->
Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body
<!-- Node #6512 -->
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,
<!-- Node #6513 -->
though he had no hand in his death, shall receive
<!-- Node #6514 -->
the benefit of his dying, a place in the
<!-- Node #6515 -->
commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this
<!-- Node #6516 -->
I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the
<!-- Node #6517 -->
good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,
<!-- Node #6518 -->
when it shall please my country to need my death.
<!-- Node #6519 -->
All
<!-- Node #6520 -->
Live, Brutus! live, live!
<!-- Node #6521 -->
First Citizen
<!-- Node #6522 -->
Bring him with triumph home unto his house.
<!-- Node #6523 -->
Second Citizen
<!-- Node #6524 -->
Give him a statue with his ancestors.
<!-- Node #6525 -->
Third Citizen
<!-- Node #6526 -->
Let him be Caesar.
<!-- Node #6527 -->
Fourth Citizen
<!-- Node #6528 -->
Caesar's better parts
<!-- Node #6529 -->
Shall be crown'd in Brutus.
<!-- Node #6530 -->
First Citizen
<!-- Node #6531 -->
We'll bring him to his house
<!-- Node #6532 -->
With shouts and clamours.
<!-- Node #6533 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6534 -->
My countrymen,--
<!-- Node #6535 -->
Second Citizen
<!-- Node #6536 -->
Peace, silence! Brutus speaks.
<!-- Node #6537 -->
First Citizen
<!-- Node #6538 -->
Peace, ho!
<!-- Node #6539 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6540 -->
Good countrymen, let me depart alone,
<!-- Node #6541 -->
And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:
<!-- Node #6542 -->
Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech
<!-- Node #6543 -->
Tending to Caesar's glories; which Mark Antony,
<!-- Node #6544 -->
By our permission, is allow'd to make.
<!-- Node #6545 -->
I do entreat you, not a man depart,
<!-- Node #6546 -->
Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
<!-- Node #6547 -->
First Citizen
<!-- Node #6548 -->
Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.
<!-- Node #6549 -->
Third Citizen
<!-- Node #6550 -->
Let him go up into the public chair;
<!-- Node #6551 -->
We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.
<!-- Node #6552 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6553 -->
For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
<!-- Node #6554 -->
Fourth Citizen
<!-- Node #6555 -->
What does he say of Brutus?
<!-- Node #6556 -->
Third Citizen
<!-- Node #6557 -->
He says, for Brutus' sake,
<!-- Node #6558 -->
He finds himself beholding to us all.
<!-- Node #6559 -->
Fourth Citizen
<!-- Node #6560 -->
'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
<!-- Node #6561 -->
First Citizen
<!-- Node #6562 -->
This Caesar was a tyrant.
<!-- Node #6563 -->
Third Citizen
<!-- Node #6564 -->
Nay, that's certain:
<!-- Node #6565 -->
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
<!-- Node #6566 -->
Second Citizen
<!-- Node #6567 -->
Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.
<!-- Node #6568 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6569 -->
You gentle Romans,--
<!-- Node #6570 -->
Citizens
<!-- Node #6571 -->
Peace, ho! let us hear him.
<!-- Node #6572 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6573 -->
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
<!-- Node #6574 -->
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
<!-- Node #6575 -->
The evil that men do lives after them;
<!-- Node #6576 -->
The good is oft interred with their bones;
<!-- Node #6577 -->
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
<!-- Node #6578 -->
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
<!-- Node #6579 -->
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
<!-- Node #6580 -->
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
<!-- Node #6581 -->
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--
<!-- Node #6582 -->
For Brutus is an honourable man;
<!-- Node #6583 -->
So are they all, all honourable men--
<!-- Node #6584 -->
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
<!-- Node #6585 -->
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
<!-- Node #6586 -->
But Brutus says he was ambitious;
<!-- Node #6587 -->
And Brutus is an honourable man.
<!-- Node #6588 -->
He hath brought many captives home to Rome
<!-- Node #6589 -->
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
<!-- Node #6590 -->
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
<!-- Node #6591 -->
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
<!-- Node #6592 -->
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
<!-- Node #6593 -->
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
<!-- Node #6594 -->
And Brutus is an honourable man.
<!-- Node #6595 -->
You all did see that on the Lupercal
<!-- Node #6596 -->
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
<!-- Node #6597 -->
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
<!-- Node #6598 -->
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
<!-- Node #6599 -->
And, sure, he is an honourable man.
<!-- Node #6600 -->
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
<!-- Node #6601 -->
But here I am to speak what I do know.
<!-- Node #6602 -->
You all did love him once, not without cause:
<!-- Node #6603 -->
What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
<!-- Node #6604 -->
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
<!-- Node #6605 -->
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
<!-- Node #6606 -->
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
<!-- Node #6607 -->
And I must pause till it come back to me.
<!-- Node #6608 -->
First Citizen
<!-- Node #6609 -->
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
<!-- Node #6610 -->
Second Citizen
<!-- Node #6611 -->
If thou consider rightly of the matter,
<!-- Node #6612 -->
Caesar has had great wrong.
<!-- Node #6613 -->
Third Citizen
<!-- Node #6614 -->
Has he, masters?
<!-- Node #6615 -->
I fear there will a worse come in his place.
<!-- Node #6616 -->
Fourth Citizen
<!-- Node #6617 -->
Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;
<!-- Node #6618 -->
Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.
<!-- Node #6619 -->
First Citizen
<!-- Node #6620 -->
If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
<!-- Node #6621 -->
Second Citizen
<!-- Node #6622 -->
Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
<!-- Node #6623 -->
Third Citizen
<!-- Node #6624 -->
There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
<!-- Node #6625 -->
Fourth Citizen
<!-- Node #6626 -->
Now mark him, he begins again to speak.
<!-- Node #6627 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6628 -->
But yesterday the word of Caesar might
<!-- Node #6629 -->
Have stood against the world; now lies he there.
<!-- Node #6630 -->
And none so poor to do him reverence.
<!-- Node #6631 -->
O masters, if I were disposed to stir
<!-- Node #6632 -->
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
<!-- Node #6633 -->
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
<!-- Node #6634 -->
Who, you all know, are honourable men:
<!-- Node #6635 -->
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
<!-- Node #6636 -->
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
<!-- Node #6637 -->
Than I will wrong such honourable men.
<!-- Node #6638 -->
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;
<!-- Node #6639 -->
I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:
<!-- Node #6640 -->
Let but the commons hear this testament--
<!-- Node #6641 -->
Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--
<!-- Node #6642 -->
And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
<!-- Node #6643 -->
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
<!-- Node #6644 -->
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
<!-- Node #6645 -->
And, dying, mention it within their wills,
<!-- Node #6646 -->
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
<!-- Node #6647 -->
Unto their issue.
<!-- Node #6648 -->
Fourth Citizen
<!-- Node #6649 -->
We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.
<!-- Node #6650 -->
All
<!-- Node #6651 -->
The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.
<!-- Node #6652 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6653 -->
Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
<!-- Node #6654 -->
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
<!-- Node #6655 -->
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
<!-- Node #6656 -->
And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,
<!-- Node #6657 -->
It will inflame you, it will make you mad:
<!-- Node #6658 -->
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;
<!-- Node #6659 -->
For, if you should, O, what would come of it!
<!-- Node #6660 -->
Fourth Citizen
<!-- Node #6661 -->
Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony;
<!-- Node #6662 -->
You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.
<!-- Node #6663 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6664 -->
Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?
<!-- Node #6665 -->
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:
<!-- Node #6666 -->
I fear I wrong the honourable men
<!-- Node #6667 -->
Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.
<!-- Node #6668 -->
Fourth Citizen
<!-- Node #6669 -->
They were traitors: honourable men!
<!-- Node #6670 -->
All
<!-- Node #6671 -->
The will! the testament!
<!-- Node #6672 -->
Second Citizen
<!-- Node #6673 -->
They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.
<!-- Node #6674 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6675 -->
You will compel me, then, to read the will?
<!-- Node #6676 -->
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,
<!-- Node #6677 -->
And let me show you him that made the will.
<!-- Node #6678 -->
Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?
<!-- Node #6679 -->
Several Citizens
<!-- Node #6680 -->
Come down.
<!-- Node #6681 -->
Second Citizen
<!-- Node #6682 -->
Descend.
<!-- Node #6683 -->
Third Citizen
<!-- Node #6684 -->
You shall have leave.
<!-- Node #6685 -->
Fourth Citizen
<!-- Node #6686 -->
A ring; stand round.
<!-- Node #6687 -->
First Citizen
<!-- Node #6688 -->
Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.
<!-- Node #6689 -->
Second Citizen
<!-- Node #6690 -->
Room for Antony, most noble Antony.
<!-- Node #6691 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6692 -->
Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.
<!-- Node #6693 -->
Several Citizens
<!-- Node #6694 -->
Stand back; room; bear back.
<!-- Node #6695 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6696 -->
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
<!-- Node #6697 -->
You all do know this mantle: I remember
<!-- Node #6698 -->
The first time ever Caesar put it on;
<!-- Node #6699 -->
'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
<!-- Node #6700 -->
That day he overcame the Nervii:
<!-- Node #6701 -->
Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:
<!-- Node #6702 -->
See what a rent the envious Casca made:
<!-- Node #6703 -->
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
<!-- Node #6704 -->
And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
<!-- Node #6705 -->
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,
<!-- Node #6706 -->
As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
<!-- Node #6707 -->
If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;
<!-- Node #6708 -->
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:
<!-- Node #6709 -->
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
<!-- Node #6710 -->
This was the most unkindest cut of all;
<!-- Node #6711 -->
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
<!-- Node #6712 -->
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
<!-- Node #6713 -->
Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
<!-- Node #6714 -->
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
<!-- Node #6715 -->
Even at the base of Pompey's statua,
<!-- Node #6716 -->
Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
<!-- Node #6717 -->
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
<!-- Node #6718 -->
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
<!-- Node #6719 -->
Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
<!-- Node #6720 -->
O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel
<!-- Node #6721 -->
The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
<!-- Node #6722 -->
Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
<!-- Node #6723 -->
Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
<!-- Node #6724 -->
Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.
<!-- Node #6725 -->
First Citizen
<!-- Node #6726 -->
O piteous spectacle!
<!-- Node #6727 -->
Second Citizen
<!-- Node #6728 -->
O noble Caesar!
<!-- Node #6729 -->
Third Citizen
<!-- Node #6730 -->
O woful day!
<!-- Node #6731 -->
Fourth Citizen
<!-- Node #6732 -->
O traitors, villains!
<!-- Node #6733 -->
First Citizen
<!-- Node #6734 -->
O most bloody sight!
<!-- Node #6735 -->
Second Citizen
<!-- Node #6736 -->
We will be revenged.
<!-- Node #6737 -->
All
<!-- Node #6738 -->
Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!
<!-- Node #6739 -->
Let not a traitor live!
<!-- Node #6740 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6741 -->
Stay, countrymen.
<!-- Node #6742 -->
First Citizen
<!-- Node #6743 -->
Peace there! hear the noble Antony.
<!-- Node #6744 -->
Second Citizen
<!-- Node #6745 -->
We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.
<!-- Node #6746 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6747 -->
Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
<!-- Node #6748 -->
To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
<!-- Node #6749 -->
They that have done this deed are honourable:
<!-- Node #6750 -->
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
<!-- Node #6751 -->
That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,
<!-- Node #6752 -->
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
<!-- Node #6753 -->
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
<!-- Node #6754 -->
I am no orator, as Brutus is;
<!-- Node #6755 -->
But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
<!-- Node #6756 -->
That love my friend; and that they know full well
<!-- Node #6757 -->
That gave me public leave to speak of him:
<!-- Node #6758 -->
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
<!-- Node #6759 -->
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
<!-- Node #6760 -->
To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;
<!-- Node #6761 -->
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
<!-- Node #6762 -->
Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,
<!-- Node #6763 -->
And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,
<!-- Node #6764 -->
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
<!-- Node #6765 -->
Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
<!-- Node #6766 -->
In every wound of Caesar that should move
<!-- Node #6767 -->
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
<!-- Node #6768 -->
All
<!-- Node #6769 -->
We'll mutiny.
<!-- Node #6770 -->
First Citizen
<!-- Node #6771 -->
We'll burn the house of Brutus.
<!-- Node #6772 -->
Third Citizen
<!-- Node #6773 -->
Away, then! come, seek the conspirators.
<!-- Node #6774 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6775 -->
Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
<!-- Node #6776 -->
All
<!-- Node #6777 -->
Peace, ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony!
<!-- Node #6778 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6779 -->
Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:
<!-- Node #6780 -->
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
<!-- Node #6781 -->
Alas, you know not: I must tell you then:
<!-- Node #6782 -->
You have forgot the will I told you of.
<!-- Node #6783 -->
All
<!-- Node #6784 -->
Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.
<!-- Node #6785 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6786 -->
Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
<!-- Node #6787 -->
To every Roman citizen he gives,
<!-- Node #6788 -->
To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.
<!-- Node #6789 -->
Second Citizen
<!-- Node #6790 -->
Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.
<!-- Node #6791 -->
Third Citizen
<!-- Node #6792 -->
O royal Caesar!
<!-- Node #6793 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6794 -->
Hear me with patience.
<!-- Node #6795 -->
All
<!-- Node #6796 -->
Peace, ho!
<!-- Node #6797 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6798 -->
Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
<!-- Node #6799 -->
His private arbours and new-planted orchards,
<!-- Node #6800 -->
On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,
<!-- Node #6801 -->
And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,
<!-- Node #6802 -->
To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
<!-- Node #6803 -->
Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?
<!-- Node #6804 -->
First Citizen
<!-- Node #6805 -->
Never, never. Come, away, away!
<!-- Node #6806 -->
We'll burn his body in the holy place,
<!-- Node #6807 -->
And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
<!-- Node #6808 -->
Take up the body.
<!-- Node #6809 -->
Second Citizen
<!-- Node #6810 -->
Go fetch fire.
<!-- Node #6811 -->
Third Citizen
<!-- Node #6812 -->
Pluck down benches.
<!-- Node #6813 -->
Fourth Citizen
<!-- Node #6814 -->
Pluck down forms, windows, any thing.
<!-- Node #6815 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6816 -->
Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
<!-- Node #6817 -->
Take thou what course thou wilt!
<!-- Node #6818 -->
Enter a Servant
<!-- Node #6819 -->
How now, fellow!
<!-- Node #6820 -->
Servant
<!-- Node #6821 -->
Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.
<!-- Node #6822 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6823 -->
Where is he?
<!-- Node #6824 -->
Servant
<!-- Node #6825 -->
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.
<!-- Node #6826 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6827 -->
And thither will I straight to visit him:
<!-- Node #6828 -->
He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,
<!-- Node #6829 -->
And in this mood will give us any thing.
<!-- Node #6830 -->
Servant
<!-- Node #6831 -->
I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius
<!-- Node #6832 -->
Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.
<!-- Node #6833 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6834 -->
Belike they had some notice of the people,
<!-- Node #6835 -->
How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.
<!-- Node #6836 -->
CINNA THE POET
<!-- Node #6837 -->
I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Caesar,
<!-- Node #6838 -->
And things unlucky charge my fantasy:
<!-- Node #6839 -->
I have no will to wander forth of doors,
<!-- Node #6840 -->
Yet something leads me forth.
<!-- Node #6841 -->
First Citizen
<!-- Node #6842 -->
What is your name?
<!-- Node #6843 -->
Second Citizen
<!-- Node #6844 -->
Whither are you going?
<!-- Node #6845 -->
Third Citizen
<!-- Node #6846 -->
Where do you dwell?
<!-- Node #6847 -->
Fourth Citizen
<!-- Node #6848 -->
Are you a married man or a bachelor?
<!-- Node #6849 -->
Second Citizen
<!-- Node #6850 -->
Answer every man directly.
<!-- Node #6851 -->
First Citizen
<!-- Node #6852 -->
Ay, and briefly.
<!-- Node #6853 -->
Fourth Citizen
<!-- Node #6854 -->
Ay, and wisely.
<!-- Node #6855 -->
Third Citizen
<!-- Node #6856 -->
Ay, and truly, you were best.
<!-- Node #6857 -->
CINNA THE POET
<!-- Node #6858 -->
What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I
<!-- Node #6859 -->
dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to
<!-- Node #6860 -->
answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and
<!-- Node #6861 -->
truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
<!-- Node #6862 -->
Second Citizen
<!-- Node #6863 -->
That's as much as to say, they are fools that marry:
<!-- Node #6864 -->
you'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed; directly.
<!-- Node #6865 -->
CINNA THE POET
<!-- Node #6866 -->
Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.
<!-- Node #6867 -->
First Citizen
<!-- Node #6868 -->
As a friend or an enemy?
<!-- Node #6869 -->
CINNA THE POET
<!-- Node #6870 -->
As a friend.
<!-- Node #6871 -->
Second Citizen
<!-- Node #6872 -->
That matter is answered directly.
<!-- Node #6873 -->
Fourth Citizen
<!-- Node #6874 -->
For your dwelling,--briefly.
<!-- Node #6875 -->
CINNA THE POET
<!-- Node #6876 -->
Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.
<!-- Node #6877 -->
Third Citizen
<!-- Node #6878 -->
Your name, sir, truly.
<!-- Node #6879 -->
CINNA THE POET
<!-- Node #6880 -->
Truly, my name is Cinna.
<!-- Node #6881 -->
First Citizen
<!-- Node #6882 -->
Tear him to pieces; he's a conspirator.
<!-- Node #6883 -->
CINNA THE POET
<!-- Node #6884 -->
I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.
<!-- Node #6885 -->
Fourth Citizen
<!-- Node #6886 -->
Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses.
<!-- Node #6887 -->
CINNA THE POET
<!-- Node #6888 -->
I am not Cinna the conspirator.
<!-- Node #6889 -->
Fourth Citizen
<!-- Node #6890 -->
It is no matter, his name's Cinna; pluck but his
<!-- Node #6891 -->
name out of his heart, and turn him going.
<!-- Node #6892 -->
Third Citizen
<!-- Node #6893 -->
Tear him, tear him! Come, brands ho! fire-brands:
<!-- Node #6894 -->
to Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all: some to Decius'
<!-- Node #6895 -->
house, and some to Casca's; some to Ligarius': away, go!
<!-- Node #6896 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6897 -->
These many, then, shall die; their names are prick'd.
<!-- Node #6898 -->
OCTAVIUS
<!-- Node #6899 -->
Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?
<!-- Node #6900 -->
LEPIDUS
<!-- Node #6901 -->
I do consent--
<!-- Node #6902 -->
OCTAVIUS
<!-- Node #6903 -->
Prick him down, Antony.
<!-- Node #6904 -->
LEPIDUS
<!-- Node #6905 -->
Upon condition Publius shall not live,
<!-- Node #6906 -->
Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.
<!-- Node #6907 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6908 -->
He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
<!-- Node #6909 -->
But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;
<!-- Node #6910 -->
Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine
<!-- Node #6911 -->
How to cut off some charge in legacies.
<!-- Node #6912 -->
LEPIDUS
<!-- Node #6913 -->
What, shall I find you here?
<!-- Node #6914 -->
OCTAVIUS
<!-- Node #6915 -->
Or here, or at the Capitol.
<!-- Node #6916 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6917 -->
This is a slight unmeritable man,
<!-- Node #6918 -->
Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,
<!-- Node #6919 -->
The three-fold world divided, he should stand
<!-- Node #6920 -->
One of the three to share it?
<!-- Node #6921 -->
OCTAVIUS
<!-- Node #6922 -->
So you thought him;
<!-- Node #6923 -->
And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,
<!-- Node #6924 -->
In our black sentence and proscription.
<!-- Node #6925 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6926 -->
Octavius, I have seen more days than you:
<!-- Node #6927 -->
And though we lay these honours on this man,
<!-- Node #6928 -->
To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,
<!-- Node #6929 -->
He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
<!-- Node #6930 -->
To groan and sweat under the business,
<!-- Node #6931 -->
Either led or driven, as we point the way;
<!-- Node #6932 -->
And having brought our treasure where we will,
<!-- Node #6933 -->
Then take we down his load, and turn him off,
<!-- Node #6934 -->
Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,
<!-- Node #6935 -->
And graze in commons.
<!-- Node #6936 -->
OCTAVIUS
<!-- Node #6937 -->
You may do your will;
<!-- Node #6938 -->
But he's a tried and valiant soldier.
<!-- Node #6939 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #6940 -->
So is my horse, Octavius; and for that
<!-- Node #6941 -->
I do appoint him store of provender:
<!-- Node #6942 -->
It is a creature that I teach to fight,
<!-- Node #6943 -->
To wind, to stop, to run directly on,
<!-- Node #6944 -->
His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.
<!-- Node #6945 -->
And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;
<!-- Node #6946 -->
He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;
<!-- Node #6947 -->
A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds
<!-- Node #6948 -->
On abjects, orts and imitations,
<!-- Node #6949 -->
Which, out of use and staled by other men,
<!-- Node #6950 -->
Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,
<!-- Node #6951 -->
But as a property. And now, Octavius,
<!-- Node #6952 -->
Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius
<!-- Node #6953 -->
Are levying powers: we must straight make head:
<!-- Node #6954 -->
Therefore let our alliance be combined,
<!-- Node #6955 -->
Our best friends made, our means stretch'd
<!-- Node #6956 -->
And let us presently go sit in council,
<!-- Node #6957 -->
How covert matters may be best disclosed,
<!-- Node #6958 -->
And open perils surest answered.
<!-- Node #6959 -->
OCTAVIUS
<!-- Node #6960 -->
Let us do so: for we are at the stake,
<!-- Node #6961 -->
And bay'd about with many enemies;
<!-- Node #6962 -->
And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,
<!-- Node #6963 -->
Millions of mischiefs.
<!-- Node #6964 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6965 -->
Stand, ho!
<!-- Node #6966 -->
LUCILIUS
<!-- Node #6967 -->
Give the word, ho! and stand.
<!-- Node #6968 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6969 -->
What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?
<!-- Node #6970 -->
LUCILIUS
<!-- Node #6971 -->
He is at hand; and Pindarus is come
<!-- Node #6972 -->
To do you salutation from his master.
<!-- Node #6973 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6974 -->
He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,
<!-- Node #6975 -->
In his own change, or by ill officers,
<!-- Node #6976 -->
Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
<!-- Node #6977 -->
Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,
<!-- Node #6978 -->
I shall be satisfied.
<!-- Node #6979 -->
PINDARUS
<!-- Node #6980 -->
I do not doubt
<!-- Node #6981 -->
But that my noble master will appear
<!-- Node #6982 -->
Such as he is, full of regard and honour.
<!-- Node #6983 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6984 -->
He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;
<!-- Node #6985 -->
How he received you, let me be resolved.
<!-- Node #6986 -->
LUCILIUS
<!-- Node #6987 -->
With courtesy and with respect enough;
<!-- Node #6988 -->
But not with such familiar instances,
<!-- Node #6989 -->
Nor with such free and friendly conference,
<!-- Node #6990 -->
As he hath used of old.
<!-- Node #6991 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #6992 -->
Thou hast described
<!-- Node #6993 -->
A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,
<!-- Node #6994 -->
When love begins to sicken and decay,
<!-- Node #6995 -->
It useth an enforced ceremony.
<!-- Node #6996 -->
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
<!-- Node #6997 -->
But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
<!-- Node #6998 -->
Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
<!-- Node #6999 -->
But when they should endure the bloody spur,
<!-- Node #7000 -->
They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,
<!-- Node #7001 -->
Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?
<!-- Node #7002 -->
LUCILIUS
<!-- Node #7003 -->
They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd;
<!-- Node #7004 -->
The greater part, the horse in general,
<!-- Node #7005 -->
Are come with Cassius.
<!-- Node #7006 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7007 -->
Hark! he is arrived.
<!-- Node #7008 -->
Low march within
<!-- Node #7009 -->
March gently on to meet him.
<!-- Node #7010 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7011 -->
Stand, ho!
<!-- Node #7012 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7013 -->
Stand, ho! Speak the word along.
<!-- Node #7014 -->
First Soldier
<!-- Node #7015 -->
Stand!
<!-- Node #7016 -->
Second Soldier
<!-- Node #7017 -->
Stand!
<!-- Node #7018 -->
Third Soldier
<!-- Node #7019 -->
Stand!
<!-- Node #7020 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7021 -->
Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
<!-- Node #7022 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7023 -->
Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies?
<!-- Node #7024 -->
And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?
<!-- Node #7025 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7026 -->
Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs;
<!-- Node #7027 -->
And when you do them--
<!-- Node #7028 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7029 -->
Cassius, be content.
<!-- Node #7030 -->
Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.
<!-- Node #7031 -->
Before the eyes of both our armies here,
<!-- Node #7032 -->
Which should perceive nothing but love from us,
<!-- Node #7033 -->
Let us not wrangle: bid them move away;
<!-- Node #7034 -->
Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,
<!-- Node #7035 -->
And I will give you audience.
<!-- Node #7036 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7037 -->
Pindarus,
<!-- Node #7038 -->
Bid our commanders lead their charges off
<!-- Node #7039 -->
A little from this ground.
<!-- Node #7040 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7041 -->
Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man
<!-- Node #7042 -->
Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
<!-- Node #7043 -->
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.
<!-- Node #7044 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7045 -->
That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
<!-- Node #7046 -->
You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella
<!-- Node #7047 -->
For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
<!-- Node #7048 -->
Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
<!-- Node #7049 -->
Because I knew the man, were slighted off.
<!-- Node #7050 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7051 -->
You wronged yourself to write in such a case.
<!-- Node #7052 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7053 -->
In such a time as this it is not meet
<!-- Node #7054 -->
That every nice offence should bear his comment.
<!-- Node #7055 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7056 -->
Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
<!-- Node #7057 -->
Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;
<!-- Node #7058 -->
To sell and mart your offices for gold
<!-- Node #7059 -->
To undeservers.
<!-- Node #7060 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7061 -->
I an itching palm!
<!-- Node #7062 -->
You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
<!-- Node #7063 -->
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
<!-- Node #7064 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7065 -->
The name of Cassius honours this corruption,
<!-- Node #7066 -->
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
<!-- Node #7067 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7068 -->
Chastisement!
<!-- Node #7069 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7070 -->
Remember March, the ides of March remember:
<!-- Node #7071 -->
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
<!-- Node #7072 -->
What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,
<!-- Node #7073 -->
And not for justice? What, shall one of us
<!-- Node #7074 -->
That struck the foremost man of all this world
<!-- Node #7075 -->
But for supporting robbers, shall we now
<!-- Node #7076 -->
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,
<!-- Node #7077 -->
And sell the mighty space of our large honours
<!-- Node #7078 -->
For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
<!-- Node #7079 -->
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
<!-- Node #7080 -->
Than such a Roman.
<!-- Node #7081 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7082 -->
Brutus, bay not me;
<!-- Node #7083 -->
I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,
<!-- Node #7084 -->
To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,
<!-- Node #7085 -->
Older in practise, abler than yourself
<!-- Node #7086 -->
To make conditions.
<!-- Node #7087 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7088 -->
Go to; you are not, Cassius.
<!-- Node #7089 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7090 -->
I am.
<!-- Node #7091 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7092 -->
I say you are not.
<!-- Node #7093 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7094 -->
Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
<!-- Node #7095 -->
Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.
<!-- Node #7096 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7097 -->
Away, slight man!
<!-- Node #7098 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7099 -->
Is't possible?
<!-- Node #7100 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7101 -->
Hear me, for I will speak.
<!-- Node #7102 -->
Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
<!-- Node #7103 -->
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
<!-- Node #7104 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7105 -->
O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?
<!-- Node #7106 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7107 -->
All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;
<!-- Node #7108 -->
Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
<!-- Node #7109 -->
And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
<!-- Node #7110 -->
Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch
<!-- Node #7111 -->
Under your testy humour? By the gods
<!-- Node #7112 -->
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
<!-- Node #7113 -->
Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,
<!-- Node #7114 -->
I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
<!-- Node #7115 -->
When you are waspish.
<!-- Node #7116 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7117 -->
Is it come to this?
<!-- Node #7118 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7119 -->
You say you are a better soldier:
<!-- Node #7120 -->
Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,
<!-- Node #7121 -->
And it shall please me well: for mine own part,
<!-- Node #7122 -->
I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
<!-- Node #7123 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7124 -->
You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;
<!-- Node #7125 -->
I said, an elder soldier, not a better:
<!-- Node #7126 -->
Did I say 'better'?
<!-- Node #7127 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7128 -->
If you did, I care not.
<!-- Node #7129 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7130 -->
When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
<!-- Node #7131 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7132 -->
Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.
<!-- Node #7133 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7134 -->
I durst not!
<!-- Node #7135 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7136 -->
No.
<!-- Node #7137 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7138 -->
What, durst not tempt him!
<!-- Node #7139 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7140 -->
For your life you durst not!
<!-- Node #7141 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7142 -->
Do not presume too much upon my love;
<!-- Node #7143 -->
I may do that I shall be sorry for.
<!-- Node #7144 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7145 -->
You have done that you should be sorry for.
<!-- Node #7146 -->
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,
<!-- Node #7147 -->
For I am arm'd so strong in honesty
<!-- Node #7148 -->
That they pass by me as the idle wind,
<!-- Node #7149 -->
Which I respect not. I did send to you
<!-- Node #7150 -->
For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:
<!-- Node #7151 -->
For I can raise no money by vile means:
<!-- Node #7152 -->
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,
<!-- Node #7153 -->
And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring
<!-- Node #7154 -->
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
<!-- Node #7155 -->
By any indirection: I did send
<!-- Node #7156 -->
To you for gold to pay my legions,
<!-- Node #7157 -->
Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?
<!-- Node #7158 -->
Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
<!-- Node #7159 -->
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,
<!-- Node #7160 -->
To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
<!-- Node #7161 -->
Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;
<!-- Node #7162 -->
Dash him to pieces!
<!-- Node #7163 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7164 -->
I denied you not.
<!-- Node #7165 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7166 -->
You did.
<!-- Node #7167 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7168 -->
I did not: he was but a fool that brought
<!-- Node #7169 -->
My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:
<!-- Node #7170 -->
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
<!-- Node #7171 -->
But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
<!-- Node #7172 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7173 -->
I do not, till you practise them on me.
<!-- Node #7174 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7175 -->
You love me not.
<!-- Node #7176 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7177 -->
I do not like your faults.
<!-- Node #7178 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7179 -->
A friendly eye could never see such faults.
<!-- Node #7180 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7181 -->
A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
<!-- Node #7182 -->
As huge as high Olympus.
<!-- Node #7183 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7184 -->
Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
<!-- Node #7185 -->
Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,
<!-- Node #7186 -->
For Cassius is aweary of the world;
<!-- Node #7187 -->
Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
<!-- Node #7188 -->
Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,
<!-- Node #7189 -->
Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,
<!-- Node #7190 -->
To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep
<!-- Node #7191 -->
My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,
<!-- Node #7192 -->
And here my naked breast; within, a heart
<!-- Node #7193 -->
Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
<!-- Node #7194 -->
If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;
<!-- Node #7195 -->
I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:
<!-- Node #7196 -->
Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,
<!-- Node #7197 -->
When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
<!-- Node #7198 -->
Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.
<!-- Node #7199 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7200 -->
Sheathe your dagger:
<!-- Node #7201 -->
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
<!-- Node #7202 -->
Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.
<!-- Node #7203 -->
O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
<!-- Node #7204 -->
That carries anger as the flint bears fire;
<!-- Node #7205 -->
Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
<!-- Node #7206 -->
And straight is cold again.
<!-- Node #7207 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7208 -->
Hath Cassius lived
<!-- Node #7209 -->
To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
<!-- Node #7210 -->
When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?
<!-- Node #7211 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7212 -->
When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.
<!-- Node #7213 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7214 -->
Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
<!-- Node #7215 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7216 -->
And my heart too.
<!-- Node #7217 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7218 -->
O Brutus!
<!-- Node #7219 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7220 -->
What's the matter?
<!-- Node #7221 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7222 -->
Have not you love enough to bear with me,
<!-- Node #7223 -->
When that rash humour which my mother gave me
<!-- Node #7224 -->
Makes me forgetful?
<!-- Node #7225 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7226 -->
Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,
<!-- Node #7227 -->
When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,
<!-- Node #7228 -->
He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.
<!-- Node #7229 -->
Poet
<!-- Node #7230 -->
<STAGEDIR>Within</STAGEDIR>
<!-- Node #7231 -->
Let me go in to see the generals;
<!-- Node #7232 -->
There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet
<!-- Node #7233 -->
They be alone.
<!-- Node #7234 -->
LUCILIUS
<!-- Node #7235 -->
<STAGEDIR>Within</STAGEDIR>
<!-- Node #7236 -->
You shall not come to them.
<!-- Node #7237 -->
Poet
<!-- Node #7238 -->
<STAGEDIR>Within</STAGEDIR>
<!-- Node #7239 -->
Nothing but death shall stay me.
<!-- Node #7240 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7241 -->
How now! what's the matter?
<!-- Node #7242 -->
Poet
<!-- Node #7243 -->
For shame, you generals! what do you mean?
<!-- Node #7244 -->
Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;
<!-- Node #7245 -->
For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.
<!-- Node #7246 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7247 -->
Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
<!-- Node #7248 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7249 -->
Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
<!-- Node #7250 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7251 -->
Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.
<!-- Node #7252 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7253 -->
I'll know his humour, when he knows his time:
<!-- Node #7254 -->
What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
<!-- Node #7255 -->
Companion, hence!
<!-- Node #7256 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7257 -->
Away, away, be gone.
<!-- Node #7258 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7259 -->
Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
<!-- Node #7260 -->
Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.
<!-- Node #7261 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7262 -->
And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you
<!-- Node #7263 -->
Immediately to us.
<!-- Node #7264 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7265 -->
Lucius, a bowl of wine!
<!-- Node #7266 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7267 -->
I did not think you could have been so angry.
<!-- Node #7268 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7269 -->
O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
<!-- Node #7270 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7271 -->
Of your philosophy you make no use,
<!-- Node #7272 -->
If you give place to accidental evils.
<!-- Node #7273 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7274 -->
No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
<!-- Node #7275 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7276 -->
Ha! Portia!
<!-- Node #7277 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7278 -->
She is dead.
<!-- Node #7279 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7280 -->
How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?
<!-- Node #7281 -->
O insupportable and touching loss!
<!-- Node #7282 -->
Upon what sickness?
<!-- Node #7283 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7284 -->
Impatient of my absence,
<!-- Node #7285 -->
And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
<!-- Node #7286 -->
Have made themselves so strong:--for with her death
<!-- Node #7287 -->
That tidings came;--with this she fell distract,
<!-- Node #7288 -->
And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.
<!-- Node #7289 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7290 -->
And died so?
<!-- Node #7291 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7292 -->
Even so.
<!-- Node #7293 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7294 -->
O ye immortal gods!
<!-- Node #7295 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7296 -->
Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
<!-- Node #7297 -->
In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.
<!-- Node #7298 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7299 -->
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
<!-- Node #7300 -->
Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;
<!-- Node #7301 -->
I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.
<!-- Node #7302 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7303 -->
Come in, Titinius!
<!-- Node #7304 -->
Exit LUCIUS
<!-- Node #7305 -->
Re-enter TITINIUS, with MESSALA
<!-- Node #7306 -->
Welcome, good Messala.
<!-- Node #7307 -->
Now sit we close about this taper here,
<!-- Node #7308 -->
And call in question our necessities.
<!-- Node #7309 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7310 -->
Portia, art thou gone?
<!-- Node #7311 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7312 -->
No more, I pray you.
<!-- Node #7313 -->
Messala, I have here received letters,
<!-- Node #7314 -->
That young Octavius and Mark Antony
<!-- Node #7315 -->
Come down upon us with a mighty power,
<!-- Node #7316 -->
Bending their expedition toward Philippi.
<!-- Node #7317 -->
MESSALA
<!-- Node #7318 -->
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.
<!-- Node #7319 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7320 -->
With what addition?
<!-- Node #7321 -->
MESSALA
<!-- Node #7322 -->
That by proscription and bills of outlawry,
<!-- Node #7323 -->
Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,
<!-- Node #7324 -->
Have put to death an hundred senators.
<!-- Node #7325 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7326 -->
Therein our letters do not well agree;
<!-- Node #7327 -->
Mine speak of seventy senators that died
<!-- Node #7328 -->
By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
<!-- Node #7329 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7330 -->
Cicero one!
<!-- Node #7331 -->
MESSALA
<!-- Node #7332 -->
Cicero is dead,
<!-- Node #7333 -->
And by that order of proscription.
<!-- Node #7334 -->
Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
<!-- Node #7335 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7336 -->
No, Messala.
<!-- Node #7337 -->
MESSALA
<!-- Node #7338 -->
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
<!-- Node #7339 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7340 -->
Nothing, Messala.
<!-- Node #7341 -->
MESSALA
<!-- Node #7342 -->
That, methinks, is strange.
<!-- Node #7343 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7344 -->
Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?
<!-- Node #7345 -->
MESSALA
<!-- Node #7346 -->
No, my lord.
<!-- Node #7347 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7348 -->
Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
<!-- Node #7349 -->
MESSALA
<!-- Node #7350 -->
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
<!-- Node #7351 -->
For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.
<!-- Node #7352 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7353 -->
Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:
<!-- Node #7354 -->
With meditating that she must die once,
<!-- Node #7355 -->
I have the patience to endure it now.
<!-- Node #7356 -->
MESSALA
<!-- Node #7357 -->
Even so great men great losses should endure.
<!-- Node #7358 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7359 -->
I have as much of this in art as you,
<!-- Node #7360 -->
But yet my nature could not bear it so.
<!-- Node #7361 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7362 -->
Well, to our work alive. What do you think
<!-- Node #7363 -->
Of marching to Philippi presently?
<!-- Node #7364 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7365 -->
I do not think it good.
<!-- Node #7366 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7367 -->
Your reason?
<!-- Node #7368 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7369 -->
This it is:
<!-- Node #7370 -->
'Tis better that the enemy seek us:
<!-- Node #7371 -->
So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
<!-- Node #7372 -->
Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,
<!-- Node #7373 -->
Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.
<!-- Node #7374 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7375 -->
Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.
<!-- Node #7376 -->
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
<!-- Node #7377 -->
Do stand but in a forced affection;
<!-- Node #7378 -->
For they have grudged us contribution:
<!-- Node #7379 -->
The enemy, marching along by them,
<!-- Node #7380 -->
By them shall make a fuller number up,
<!-- Node #7381 -->
Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;
<!-- Node #7382 -->
From which advantage shall we cut him off,
<!-- Node #7383 -->
If at Philippi we do face him there,
<!-- Node #7384 -->
These people at our back.
<!-- Node #7385 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7386 -->
Hear me, good brother.
<!-- Node #7387 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7388 -->
Under your pardon. You must note beside,
<!-- Node #7389 -->
That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
<!-- Node #7390 -->
Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:
<!-- Node #7391 -->
The enemy increaseth every day;
<!-- Node #7392 -->
We, at the height, are ready to decline.
<!-- Node #7393 -->
There is a tide in the affairs of men,
<!-- Node #7394 -->
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
<!-- Node #7395 -->
Omitted, all the voyage of their life
<!-- Node #7396 -->
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
<!-- Node #7397 -->
On such a full sea are we now afloat;
<!-- Node #7398 -->
And we must take the current when it serves,
<!-- Node #7399 -->
Or lose our ventures.
<!-- Node #7400 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7401 -->
Then, with your will, go on;
<!-- Node #7402 -->
We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.
<!-- Node #7403 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7404 -->
The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
<!-- Node #7405 -->
And nature must obey necessity;
<!-- Node #7406 -->
Which we will niggard with a little rest.
<!-- Node #7407 -->
There is no more to say?
<!-- Node #7408 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7409 -->
No more. Good night:
<!-- Node #7410 -->
Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
<!-- Node #7411 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7412 -->
Lucius!
<!-- Node #7413 -->
Enter LUCIUS
<!-- Node #7414 -->
My gown.
<!-- Node #7415 -->
Exit LUCIUS
<!-- Node #7416 -->
Farewell, good Messala:
<!-- Node #7417 -->
Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,
<!-- Node #7418 -->
Good night, and good repose.
<!-- Node #7419 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7420 -->
O my dear brother!
<!-- Node #7421 -->
This was an ill beginning of the night:
<!-- Node #7422 -->
Never come such division 'tween our souls!
<!-- Node #7423 -->
Let it not, Brutus.
<!-- Node #7424 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7425 -->
Every thing is well.
<!-- Node #7426 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7427 -->
Good night, my lord.
<!-- Node #7428 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7429 -->
Good night, good brother.
<!-- Node #7430 -->
TITINIUS
<!-- Node #7431 -->
MESSALA
<!-- Node #7432 -->
Good night, Lord Brutus.
<!-- Node #7433 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7434 -->
Farewell, every one.
<!-- Node #7435 -->
Exeunt all but BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7436 -->
Re-enter LUCIUS, with the gown
<!-- Node #7437 -->
Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?
<!-- Node #7438 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #7439 -->
Here in the tent.
<!-- Node #7440 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7441 -->
What, thou speak'st drowsily?
<!-- Node #7442 -->
Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o'er-watch'd.
<!-- Node #7443 -->
Call Claudius and some other of my men:
<!-- Node #7444 -->
I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
<!-- Node #7445 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #7446 -->
Varro and Claudius!
<!-- Node #7447 -->
VARRO
<!-- Node #7448 -->
Calls my lord?
<!-- Node #7449 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7450 -->
I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
<!-- Node #7451 -->
It may be I shall raise you by and by
<!-- Node #7452 -->
On business to my brother Cassius.
<!-- Node #7453 -->
VARRO
<!-- Node #7454 -->
So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
<!-- Node #7455 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7456 -->
I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;
<!-- Node #7457 -->
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
<!-- Node #7458 -->
Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;
<!-- Node #7459 -->
I put it in the pocket of my gown.
<!-- Node #7460 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #7461 -->
I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
<!-- Node #7462 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7463 -->
Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
<!-- Node #7464 -->
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,
<!-- Node #7465 -->
And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
<!-- Node #7466 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #7467 -->
Ay, my lord, an't please you.
<!-- Node #7468 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7469 -->
It does, my boy:
<!-- Node #7470 -->
I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.
<!-- Node #7471 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #7472 -->
It is my duty, sir.
<!-- Node #7473 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7474 -->
I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
<!-- Node #7475 -->
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
<!-- Node #7476 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #7477 -->
I have slept, my lord, already.
<!-- Node #7478 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7479 -->
It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;
<!-- Node #7480 -->
I will not hold thee long: if I do live,
<!-- Node #7481 -->
I will be good to thee.
<!-- Node #7482 -->
Music, and a song
<!-- Node #7483 -->
This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,
<!-- Node #7484 -->
Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
<!-- Node #7485 -->
That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;
<!-- Node #7486 -->
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:
<!-- Node #7487 -->
If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;
<!-- Node #7488 -->
I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
<!-- Node #7489 -->
Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down
<!-- Node #7490 -->
Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.
<!-- Node #7491 -->
Enter the Ghost of CAESAR
<!-- Node #7492 -->
How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?
<!-- Node #7493 -->
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
<!-- Node #7494 -->
That shapes this monstrous apparition.
<!-- Node #7495 -->
It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?
<!-- Node #7496 -->
Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,
<!-- Node #7497 -->
That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?
<!-- Node #7498 -->
Speak to me what thou art.
<!-- Node #7499 -->
GHOST
<!-- Node #7500 -->
Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
<!-- Node #7501 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7502 -->
Why comest thou?
<!-- Node #7503 -->
GHOST
<!-- Node #7504 -->
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
<!-- Node #7505 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7506 -->
Well; then I shall see thee again?
<!-- Node #7507 -->
GHOST
<!-- Node #7508 -->
Ay, at Philippi.
<!-- Node #7509 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7510 -->
Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.
<!-- Node #7511 -->
Exit Ghost
<!-- Node #7512 -->
Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:
<!-- Node #7513 -->
Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.
<!-- Node #7514 -->
Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!
<!-- Node #7515 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #7516 -->
The strings, my lord, are false.
<!-- Node #7517 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7518 -->
He thinks he still is at his instrument.
<!-- Node #7519 -->
Lucius, awake!
<!-- Node #7520 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #7521 -->
My lord?
<!-- Node #7522 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7523 -->
Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
<!-- Node #7524 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #7525 -->
My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
<!-- Node #7526 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7527 -->
Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?
<!-- Node #7528 -->
LUCIUS
<!-- Node #7529 -->
Nothing, my lord.
<!-- Node #7530 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7531 -->
Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!
<!-- Node #7532 -->
To VARRO
<!-- Node #7533 -->
Fellow thou, awake!
<!-- Node #7534 -->
VARRO
<!-- Node #7535 -->
My lord?
<!-- Node #7536 -->
CLAUDIUS
<!-- Node #7537 -->
My lord?
<!-- Node #7538 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7539 -->
Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
<!-- Node #7540 -->
VARRO
<!-- Node #7541 -->
CLAUDIUS
<!-- Node #7542 -->
Did we, my lord?
<!-- Node #7543 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7544 -->
Ay: saw you any thing?
<!-- Node #7545 -->
VARRO
<!-- Node #7546 -->
No, my lord, I saw nothing.
<!-- Node #7547 -->
CLAUDIUS
<!-- Node #7548 -->
Nor I, my lord.
<!-- Node #7549 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7550 -->
Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
<!-- Node #7551 -->
Bid him set on his powers betimes before,
<!-- Node #7552 -->
And we will follow.
<!-- Node #7553 -->
VARRO
<!-- Node #7554 -->
CLAUDIUS
<!-- Node #7555 -->
It shall be done, my lord.
<!-- Node #7556 -->
OCTAVIUS
<!-- Node #7557 -->
Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:
<!-- Node #7558 -->
You said the enemy would not come down,
<!-- Node #7559 -->
But keep the hills and upper regions;
<!-- Node #7560 -->
It proves not so: their battles are at hand;
<!-- Node #7561 -->
They mean to warn us at Philippi here,
<!-- Node #7562 -->
Answering before we do demand of them.
<!-- Node #7563 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #7564 -->
Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
<!-- Node #7565 -->
Wherefore they do it: they could be content
<!-- Node #7566 -->
To visit other places; and come down
<!-- Node #7567 -->
With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
<!-- Node #7568 -->
To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
<!-- Node #7569 -->
But 'tis not so.
<!-- Node #7570 -->
Messenger
<!-- Node #7571 -->
Prepare you, generals:
<!-- Node #7572 -->
The enemy comes on in gallant show;
<!-- Node #7573 -->
Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,
<!-- Node #7574 -->
And something to be done immediately.
<!-- Node #7575 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #7576 -->
Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
<!-- Node #7577 -->
Upon the left hand of the even field.
<!-- Node #7578 -->
OCTAVIUS
<!-- Node #7579 -->
Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.
<!-- Node #7580 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #7581 -->
Why do you cross me in this exigent?
<!-- Node #7582 -->
OCTAVIUS
<!-- Node #7583 -->
I do not cross you; but I will do so.
<!-- Node #7584 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7585 -->
They stand, and would have parley.
<!-- Node #7586 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7587 -->
Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk.
<!-- Node #7588 -->
OCTAVIUS
<!-- Node #7589 -->
Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
<!-- Node #7590 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #7591 -->
No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
<!-- Node #7592 -->
Make forth; the generals would have some words.
<!-- Node #7593 -->
OCTAVIUS
<!-- Node #7594 -->
Stir not until the signal.
<!-- Node #7595 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7596 -->
Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?
<!-- Node #7597 -->
OCTAVIUS
<!-- Node #7598 -->
Not that we love words better, as you do.
<!-- Node #7599 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7600 -->
Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
<!-- Node #7601 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #7602 -->
In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:
<!-- Node #7603 -->
Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,
<!-- Node #7604 -->
Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'
<!-- Node #7605 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7606 -->
Antony,
<!-- Node #7607 -->
The posture of your blows are yet unknown;
<!-- Node #7608 -->
But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,
<!-- Node #7609 -->
And leave them honeyless.
<!-- Node #7610 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #7611 -->
Not stingless too.
<!-- Node #7612 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7613 -->
O, yes, and soundless too;
<!-- Node #7614 -->
For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,
<!-- Node #7615 -->
And very wisely threat before you sting.
<!-- Node #7616 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #7617 -->
Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers
<!-- Node #7618 -->
Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:
<!-- Node #7619 -->
You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,
<!-- Node #7620 -->
And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;
<!-- Node #7621 -->
Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind
<!-- Node #7622 -->
Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!
<!-- Node #7623 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7624 -->
Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:
<!-- Node #7625 -->
This tongue had not offended so to-day,
<!-- Node #7626 -->
If Cassius might have ruled.
<!-- Node #7627 -->
OCTAVIUS
<!-- Node #7628 -->
Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,
<!-- Node #7629 -->
The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;
<!-- Node #7630 -->
I draw a sword against conspirators;
<!-- Node #7631 -->
When think you that the sword goes up again?
<!-- Node #7632 -->
Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds
<!-- Node #7633 -->
Be well avenged; or till another Caesar
<!-- Node #7634 -->
Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
<!-- Node #7635 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7636 -->
Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
<!-- Node #7637 -->
Unless thou bring'st them with thee.
<!-- Node #7638 -->
OCTAVIUS
<!-- Node #7639 -->
So I hope;
<!-- Node #7640 -->
I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
<!-- Node #7641 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7642 -->
O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
<!-- Node #7643 -->
Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.
<!-- Node #7644 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7645 -->
A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,
<!-- Node #7646 -->
Join'd with a masker and a reveller!
<!-- Node #7647 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #7648 -->
Old Cassius still!
<!-- Node #7649 -->
OCTAVIUS
<!-- Node #7650 -->
Come, Antony, away!
<!-- Node #7651 -->
Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:
<!-- Node #7652 -->
If you dare fight to-day, come to the field;
<!-- Node #7653 -->
If not, when you have stomachs.
<!-- Node #7654 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7655 -->
Why, now, blow wind, swell billow and swim bark!
<!-- Node #7656 -->
The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.
<!-- Node #7657 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7658 -->
Ho, Lucilius! hark, a word with you.
<!-- Node #7659 -->
LUCILIUS
<!-- Node #7660 -->
<STAGEDIR>Standing forth</STAGEDIR>
<!-- Node #7661 -->
My lord?
<!-- Node #7662 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7663 -->
Messala!
<!-- Node #7664 -->
MESSALA
<!-- Node #7665 -->
<STAGEDIR>Standing forth</STAGEDIR>
<!-- Node #7666 -->
What says my general?
<!-- Node #7667 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7668 -->
Messala,
<!-- Node #7669 -->
This is my birth-day; as this very day
<!-- Node #7670 -->
Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:
<!-- Node #7671 -->
Be thou my witness that against my will,
<!-- Node #7672 -->
As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set
<!-- Node #7673 -->
Upon one battle all our liberties.
<!-- Node #7674 -->
You know that I held Epicurus strong
<!-- Node #7675 -->
And his opinion: now I change my mind,
<!-- Node #7676 -->
And partly credit things that do presage.
<!-- Node #7677 -->
Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
<!-- Node #7678 -->
Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,
<!-- Node #7679 -->
Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;
<!-- Node #7680 -->
Who to Philippi here consorted us:
<!-- Node #7681 -->
This morning are they fled away and gone;
<!-- Node #7682 -->
And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,
<!-- Node #7683 -->
Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,
<!-- Node #7684 -->
As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
<!-- Node #7685 -->
A canopy most fatal, under which
<!-- Node #7686 -->
Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.
<!-- Node #7687 -->
MESSALA
<!-- Node #7688 -->
Believe not so.
<!-- Node #7689 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7690 -->
I but believe it partly;
<!-- Node #7691 -->
For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
<!-- Node #7692 -->
To meet all perils very constantly.
<!-- Node #7693 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7694 -->
Even so, Lucilius.
<!-- Node #7695 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7696 -->
Now, most noble Brutus,
<!-- Node #7697 -->
The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,
<!-- Node #7698 -->
Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
<!-- Node #7699 -->
But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,
<!-- Node #7700 -->
Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
<!-- Node #7701 -->
If we do lose this battle, then is this
<!-- Node #7702 -->
The very last time we shall speak together:
<!-- Node #7703 -->
What are you then determined to do?
<!-- Node #7704 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7705 -->
Even by the rule of that philosophy
<!-- Node #7706 -->
By which I did blame Cato for the death
<!-- Node #7707 -->
Which he did give himself, I know not how,
<!-- Node #7708 -->
But I do find it cowardly and vile,
<!-- Node #7709 -->
For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
<!-- Node #7710 -->
The time of life: arming myself with patience
<!-- Node #7711 -->
To stay the providence of some high powers
<!-- Node #7712 -->
That govern us below.
<!-- Node #7713 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7714 -->
Then, if we lose this battle,
<!-- Node #7715 -->
You are contented to be led in triumph
<!-- Node #7716 -->
Thorough the streets of Rome?
<!-- Node #7717 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7718 -->
No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,
<!-- Node #7719 -->
That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
<!-- Node #7720 -->
He bears too great a mind. But this same day
<!-- Node #7721 -->
Must end that work the ides of March begun;
<!-- Node #7722 -->
And whether we shall meet again I know not.
<!-- Node #7723 -->
Therefore our everlasting farewell take:
<!-- Node #7724 -->
For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!
<!-- Node #7725 -->
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
<!-- Node #7726 -->
If not, why then, this parting was well made.
<!-- Node #7727 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7728 -->
For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!
<!-- Node #7729 -->
If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
<!-- Node #7730 -->
If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.
<!-- Node #7731 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7732 -->
Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know
<!-- Node #7733 -->
The end of this day's business ere it come!
<!-- Node #7734 -->
But it sufficeth that the day will end,
<!-- Node #7735 -->
And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!
<!-- Node #7736 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7737 -->
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
<!-- Node #7738 -->
Unto the legions on the other side.
<!-- Node #7739 -->
Loud alarum
<!-- Node #7740 -->
Let them set on at once; for I perceive
<!-- Node #7741 -->
But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing,
<!-- Node #7742 -->
And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
<!-- Node #7743 -->
Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.
<!-- Node #7744 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7745 -->
O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
<!-- Node #7746 -->
Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy:
<!-- Node #7747 -->
This ensign here of mine was turning back;
<!-- Node #7748 -->
I slew the coward, and did take it from him.
<!-- Node #7749 -->
TITINIUS
<!-- Node #7750 -->
O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;
<!-- Node #7751 -->
Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
<!-- Node #7752 -->
Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,
<!-- Node #7753 -->
Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
<!-- Node #7754 -->
PINDARUS
<!-- Node #7755 -->
Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
<!-- Node #7756 -->
Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord
<!-- Node #7757 -->
Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.
<!-- Node #7758 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7759 -->
This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius;
<!-- Node #7760 -->
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?
<!-- Node #7761 -->
TITINIUS
<!-- Node #7762 -->
They are, my lord.
<!-- Node #7763 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7764 -->
Titinius, if thou lovest me,
<!-- Node #7765 -->
Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him,
<!-- Node #7766 -->
Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops,
<!-- Node #7767 -->
And here again; that I may rest assured
<!-- Node #7768 -->
Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.
<!-- Node #7769 -->
TITINIUS
<!-- Node #7770 -->
I will be here again, even with a thought.
<!-- Node #7771 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7772 -->
Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
<!-- Node #7773 -->
My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,
<!-- Node #7774 -->
And tell me what thou notest about the field.
<!-- Node #7775 -->
PINDARUS ascends the hill
<!-- Node #7776 -->
This day I breathed first: time is come round,
<!-- Node #7777 -->
And where I did begin, there shall I end;
<!-- Node #7778 -->
My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?
<!-- Node #7779 -->
PINDARUS
<!-- Node #7780 -->
<STAGEDIR>Above</STAGEDIR>
<!-- Node #7781 -->
O my lord!
<!-- Node #7782 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7783 -->
What news?
<!-- Node #7784 -->
PINDARUS
<!-- Node #7785 -->
<STAGEDIR>Above</STAGEDIR>
<!-- Node #7786 -->
Titinius is enclosed round about
<!-- Node #7787 -->
With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;
<!-- Node #7788 -->
Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.
<!-- Node #7789 -->
Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.
<!-- Node #7790 -->
He's ta'en.
<!-- Node #7791 -->
Shout
<!-- Node #7792 -->
And, hark! they shout for joy.
<!-- Node #7793 -->
CASSIUS
<!-- Node #7794 -->
Come down, behold no more.
<!-- Node #7795 -->
O, coward that I am, to live so long,
<!-- Node #7796 -->
To see my best friend ta'en before my face!
<!-- Node #7797 -->
PINDARUS descends
<!-- Node #7798 -->
Come hither, sirrah:
<!-- Node #7799 -->
In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;
<!-- Node #7800 -->
And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,
<!-- Node #7801 -->
That whatsoever I did bid thee do,
<!-- Node #7802 -->
Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;
<!-- Node #7803 -->
Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,
<!-- Node #7804 -->
That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.
<!-- Node #7805 -->
Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;
<!-- Node #7806 -->
And, when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,
<!-- Node #7807 -->
Guide thou the sword.
<!-- Node #7808 -->
PINDARUS stabs him
<!-- Node #7809 -->
Caesar, thou art revenged,
<!-- Node #7810 -->
Even with the sword that kill'd thee.
<!-- Node #7811 -->
PINDARUS
<!-- Node #7812 -->
So, I am free; yet would not so have been,
<!-- Node #7813 -->
Durst I have done my will. O Cassius,
<!-- Node #7814 -->
Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
<!-- Node #7815 -->
Where never Roman shall take note of him.
<!-- Node #7816 -->
MESSALA
<!-- Node #7817 -->
It is but change, Titinius; for Octavius
<!-- Node #7818 -->
Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,
<!-- Node #7819 -->
As Cassius' legions are by Antony.
<!-- Node #7820 -->
TITINIUS
<!-- Node #7821 -->
These tidings will well comfort Cassius.
<!-- Node #7822 -->
MESSALA
<!-- Node #7823 -->
Where did you leave him?
<!-- Node #7824 -->
TITINIUS
<!-- Node #7825 -->
All disconsolate,
<!-- Node #7826 -->
With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.
<!-- Node #7827 -->
MESSALA
<!-- Node #7828 -->
Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
<!-- Node #7829 -->
TITINIUS
<!-- Node #7830 -->
He lies not like the living. O my heart!
<!-- Node #7831 -->
MESSALA
<!-- Node #7832 -->
Is not that he?
<!-- Node #7833 -->
TITINIUS
<!-- Node #7834 -->
No, this was he, Messala,
<!-- Node #7835 -->
But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,
<!-- Node #7836 -->
As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,
<!-- Node #7837 -->
So in his red blood Cassius' day is set;
<!-- Node #7838 -->
The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;
<!-- Node #7839 -->
Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!
<!-- Node #7840 -->
Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.
<!-- Node #7841 -->
MESSALA
<!-- Node #7842 -->
Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
<!-- Node #7843 -->
O hateful error, melancholy's child,
<!-- Node #7844 -->
Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
<!-- Node #7845 -->
The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,
<!-- Node #7846 -->
Thou never comest unto a happy birth,
<!-- Node #7847 -->
But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!
<!-- Node #7848 -->
TITINIUS
<!-- Node #7849 -->
What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?
<!-- Node #7850 -->
MESSALA
<!-- Node #7851 -->
Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
<!-- Node #7852 -->
The noble Brutus, thrusting this report
<!-- Node #7853 -->
Into his ears; I may say, thrusting it;
<!-- Node #7854 -->
For piercing steel and darts envenomed
<!-- Node #7855 -->
Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
<!-- Node #7856 -->
As tidings of this sight.
<!-- Node #7857 -->
TITINIUS
<!-- Node #7858 -->
Hie you, Messala,
<!-- Node #7859 -->
And I will seek for Pindarus the while.
<!-- Node #7860 -->
Exit MESSALA
<!-- Node #7861 -->
Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
<!-- Node #7862 -->
Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they
<!-- Node #7863 -->
Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
<!-- Node #7864 -->
And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
<!-- Node #7865 -->
Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!
<!-- Node #7866 -->
But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
<!-- Node #7867 -->
Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
<!-- Node #7868 -->
Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
<!-- Node #7869 -->
And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
<!-- Node #7870 -->
By your leave, gods:--this is a Roman's part
<!-- Node #7871 -->
Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
<!-- Node #7872 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7873 -->
Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
<!-- Node #7874 -->
MESSALA
<!-- Node #7875 -->
Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
<!-- Node #7876 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7877 -->
Titinius' face is upward.
<!-- Node #7878 -->
CATO
<!-- Node #7879 -->
He is slain.
<!-- Node #7880 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7881 -->
O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
<!-- Node #7882 -->
Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
<!-- Node #7883 -->
In our own proper entrails.
<!-- Node #7884 -->
CATO
<!-- Node #7885 -->
Brave Titinius!
<!-- Node #7886 -->
Look, whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!
<!-- Node #7887 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7888 -->
Are yet two Romans living such as these?
<!-- Node #7889 -->
The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
<!-- Node #7890 -->
It is impossible that ever Rome
<!-- Node #7891 -->
Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears
<!-- Node #7892 -->
To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
<!-- Node #7893 -->
I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.
<!-- Node #7894 -->
Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:
<!-- Node #7895 -->
His funerals shall not be in our camp,
<!-- Node #7896 -->
Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;
<!-- Node #7897 -->
And come, young Cato; let us to the field.
<!-- Node #7898 -->
Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:
<!-- Node #7899 -->
'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere night
<!-- Node #7900 -->
We shall try fortune in a second fight.
<!-- Node #7901 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7902 -->
Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
<!-- Node #7903 -->
CATO
<!-- Node #7904 -->
What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
<!-- Node #7905 -->
I will proclaim my name about the field:
<!-- Node #7906 -->
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
<!-- Node #7907 -->
A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend;
<!-- Node #7908 -->
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
<!-- Node #7909 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7910 -->
And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;
<!-- Node #7911 -->
Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!
<!-- Node #7912 -->
LUCILIUS
<!-- Node #7913 -->
O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
<!-- Node #7914 -->
Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius;
<!-- Node #7915 -->
And mayst be honour'd, being Cato's son.
<!-- Node #7916 -->
First Soldier
<!-- Node #7917 -->
Yield, or thou diest.
<!-- Node #7918 -->
LUCILIUS
<!-- Node #7919 -->
Only I yield to die:
<!-- Node #7920 -->
There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;
<!-- Node #7921 -->
Offering money
<!-- Node #7922 -->
Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.
<!-- Node #7923 -->
First Soldier
<!-- Node #7924 -->
We must not. A noble prisoner!
<!-- Node #7925 -->
Second Soldier
<!-- Node #7926 -->
Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.
<!-- Node #7927 -->
First Soldier
<!-- Node #7928 -->
I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.
<!-- Node #7929 -->
Enter ANTONY
<!-- Node #7930 -->
Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.
<!-- Node #7931 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #7932 -->
Where is he?
<!-- Node #7933 -->
LUCILIUS
<!-- Node #7934 -->
Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
<!-- Node #7935 -->
I dare assure thee that no enemy
<!-- Node #7936 -->
Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus:
<!-- Node #7937 -->
The gods defend him from so great a shame!
<!-- Node #7938 -->
When you do find him, or alive or dead,
<!-- Node #7939 -->
He will be found like Brutus, like himself.
<!-- Node #7940 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #7941 -->
This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,
<!-- Node #7942 -->
A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;
<!-- Node #7943 -->
Give him all kindness: I had rather have
<!-- Node #7944 -->
Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,
<!-- Node #7945 -->
And see whether Brutus be alive or dead;
<!-- Node #7946 -->
And bring us word unto Octavius' tent
<!-- Node #7947 -->
How every thing is chanced.
<!-- Node #7948 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7949 -->
Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
<!-- Node #7950 -->
CLITUS
<!-- Node #7951 -->
Statilius show'd the torch-light, but, my lord,
<!-- Node #7952 -->
He came not back: he is or ta'en or slain.
<!-- Node #7953 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7954 -->
Sit thee down, Clitus: slaying is the word;
<!-- Node #7955 -->
It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.
<!-- Node #7956 -->
CLITUS
<!-- Node #7957 -->
What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
<!-- Node #7958 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7959 -->
Peace then! no words.
<!-- Node #7960 -->
CLITUS
<!-- Node #7961 -->
I'll rather kill myself.
<!-- Node #7962 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7963 -->
Hark thee, Dardanius.
<!-- Node #7964 -->
DARDANIUS
<!-- Node #7965 -->
Shall I do such a deed?
<!-- Node #7966 -->
CLITUS
<!-- Node #7967 -->
O Dardanius!
<!-- Node #7968 -->
DARDANIUS
<!-- Node #7969 -->
O Clitus!
<!-- Node #7970 -->
CLITUS
<!-- Node #7971 -->
What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
<!-- Node #7972 -->
DARDANIUS
<!-- Node #7973 -->
To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
<!-- Node #7974 -->
CLITUS
<!-- Node #7975 -->
Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
<!-- Node #7976 -->
That it runs over even at his eyes.
<!-- Node #7977 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7978 -->
Come hither, good Volumnius; list a word.
<!-- Node #7979 -->
VOLUMNIUS
<!-- Node #7980 -->
What says my lord?
<!-- Node #7981 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7982 -->
Why, this, Volumnius:
<!-- Node #7983 -->
The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me
<!-- Node #7984 -->
Two several times by night; at Sardis once,
<!-- Node #7985 -->
And, this last night, here in Philippi fields:
<!-- Node #7986 -->
I know my hour is come.
<!-- Node #7987 -->
VOLUMNIUS
<!-- Node #7988 -->
Not so, my lord.
<!-- Node #7989 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #7990 -->
Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
<!-- Node #7991 -->
Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;
<!-- Node #7992 -->
Our enemies have beat us to the pit:
<!-- Node #7993 -->
Low alarums
<!-- Node #7994 -->
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,
<!-- Node #7995 -->
Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,
<!-- Node #7996 -->
Thou know'st that we two went to school together:
<!-- Node #7997 -->
Even for that our love of old, I prithee,
<!-- Node #7998 -->
Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.
<!-- Node #7999 -->
VOLUMNIUS
<!-- Node #8000 -->
That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
<!-- Node #8001 -->
CLITUS
<!-- Node #8002 -->
Fly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here.
<!-- Node #8003 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #8004 -->
Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.
<!-- Node #8005 -->
Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
<!-- Node #8006 -->
Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,
<!-- Node #8007 -->
My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
<!-- Node #8008 -->
I found no man but he was true to me.
<!-- Node #8009 -->
I shall have glory by this losing day
<!-- Node #8010 -->
More than Octavius and Mark Antony
<!-- Node #8011 -->
By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
<!-- Node #8012 -->
So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue
<!-- Node #8013 -->
Hath almost ended his life's history:
<!-- Node #8014 -->
Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,
<!-- Node #8015 -->
That have but labour'd to attain this hour.
<!-- Node #8016 -->
CLITUS
<!-- Node #8017 -->
Fly, my lord, fly.
<!-- Node #8018 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #8019 -->
Hence! I will follow.
<!-- Node #8020 -->
Exeunt CLITUS, DARDANIUS, and VOLUMNIUS
<!-- Node #8021 -->
I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:
<!-- Node #8022 -->
Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
<!-- Node #8023 -->
Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:
<!-- Node #8024 -->
Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,
<!-- Node #8025 -->
While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?
<!-- Node #8026 -->
STRATO
<!-- Node #8027 -->
Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.
<!-- Node #8028 -->
BRUTUS
<!-- Node #8029 -->
Farewell, good Strato.
<!-- Node #8030 -->
Runs on his sword
<!-- Node #8031 -->
Caesar, now be still:
<!-- Node #8032 -->
I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.
<!-- Node #8033 -->
OCTAVIUS
<!-- Node #8034 -->
What man is that?
<!-- Node #8035 -->
MESSALA
<!-- Node #8036 -->
My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?
<!-- Node #8037 -->
STRATO
<!-- Node #8038 -->
Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
<!-- Node #8039 -->
The conquerors can but make a fire of him;
<!-- Node #8040 -->
For Brutus only overcame himself,
<!-- Node #8041 -->
And no man else hath honour by his death.
<!-- Node #8042 -->
LUCILIUS
<!-- Node #8043 -->
So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
<!-- Node #8044 -->
That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.
<!-- Node #8045 -->
OCTAVIUS
<!-- Node #8046 -->
All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
<!-- Node #8047 -->
Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
<!-- Node #8048 -->
STRATO
<!-- Node #8049 -->
Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
<!-- Node #8050 -->
OCTAVIUS
<!-- Node #8051 -->
Do so, good Messala.
<!-- Node #8052 -->
MESSALA
<!-- Node #8053 -->
How died my master, Strato?
<!-- Node #8054 -->
STRATO
<!-- Node #8055 -->
I held the sword, and he did run on it.
<!-- Node #8056 -->
MESSALA
<!-- Node #8057 -->
Octavius, then take him to follow thee,
<!-- Node #8058 -->
That did the latest service to my master.
<!-- Node #8059 -->
ANTONY
<!-- Node #8060 -->
This was the noblest Roman of them all:
<!-- Node #8061 -->
All the conspirators save only he
<!-- Node #8062 -->
Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;
<!-- Node #8063 -->
He only, in a general honest thought
<!-- Node #8064 -->
And common good to all, made one of them.
<!-- Node #8065 -->
His life was gentle, and the elements
<!-- Node #8066 -->
So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
<!-- Node #8067 -->
And say to all the world 'This was a man!'
<!-- Node #8068 -->
OCTAVIUS
<!-- Node #8069 -->
According to his virtue let us use him,
<!-- Node #8070 -->
With all respect and rites of burial.
<!-- Node #8071 -->
Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,
<!-- Node #8072 -->
Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.
<!-- Node #8073 -->
So call the field to rest; and let's away,
<!-- Node #8074 -->
To part the glories of this happy day.
<!-- Node #8075 -->
