# CSE 232B Project - Team \#3

## Milestone \#1

* Build (requires gradle):
```bash
gradle build
```
This will run the tests, compile and place the XPath fat jar into the folder ```demo/```, and generate the javadoc documentation

* Run XPath:
  ```bash
  cd demo/
  ```
  Save the XPath query in ```xpath-input.txt```

  To run the XPath query, execute
  ```bash
  ./xpath.sh
  ```
  The resulting list of nodes will be stored in ```xpath-output.xml``` and displayed in the terminal
